Until about 2004, a single model of parallel programming, bulk synchronous using the MPI model, was sufficient to permit translation into reasonable parallel programs for more complex applications. Starting in 2004, however, a confluence of events changed forever the architectural landscape that underpinned MPI. The first half of this article goes into the underlying reasons for these changes, and what they mean for system architectures. The second half then addresses the view going forward in terms of our standard scaling models and their profound implications for future programming and algorithm design.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2013.95","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634083","Computer architecture;Market research;Transistors;Programming;Computational modeling;Memory management;Systems engineering and theory;scientific computing;exascale;HPC;computer architecture;programming models","Computer architecture;Market research;Transistors;Programming;Computational modeling;Memory management;Systems engineering and theory","application program interfaces;computer architecture;floating point arithmetic;linear algebra;mainframes;message passing;parallel machines;parallel programming","standard scaling models;system architectures;MPI model;bulk synchronous;parallel programming;linear algebra;single floating-point benchmark;supercomputer;computer architecture;exascale computing","","51","","13","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, there will be multiple paths to Exascale, with each system relying on processor and accelerator technologies from different vendors. As such, applications will be required to be portable between these different architectures, but it is also critical that they are efficient too. These double requirements for portability and efficiency begets the need for performance portability. In this study we survey the performance portability of different programming models, including the open standards OpenMP and SYCL, across the diverse landscape of Exascale and pre-Exascale processors from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Fujitsu, Marvell, and Amazon, together encompassing GPUs and CPUs based on both x86 and Arm architectures.

To tackle the energy consumption challenge while continuing to provide tremendous performance, the HPC community have rapidly adopted GPU-based systems. Today, GPUs have became the most prevailing components in the massively parallel HPC landscape thanks to their high computational power and energy efficiency. Modeling the energy consumption of applications running on GPUs has gained a lot of attention for the last years. Alas, the HPC community lacks simple yet accurate simulators to predict the energy consumption of general purpose GPU applications. In this work, we address the prediction of the energy consumption of CUDA kernels via simulation. We propose in this paper a simple and lightweight energy model that we implemented using the open-source framework SimGrid. Our proposed model is validated across a diverse set of CUDA kernels and on two different NVIDIA GPUs (Tesla M2075 and Kepler K20Xm). As our modeling approach is not based on performance counters or detailed-architecture parameters, we believe that our model can be easily approved by users who take care of the energy consumption of their GPGPU applications.","2643-3001","978-1-7281-9924-5","10.1109/SBAC-PAD49847.2020.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9235065","GPGPU computing, CUDA kernels, Energy modeling, Simulation","Graphics processing units;Kernel;Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Instruction sets;Computer architecture;Scheduling","application program interfaces;coprocessors;graphics processing units;grid computing;parallel architectures;parallel processing;power aware computing;public domain software","high performance computing;energy consumption challenge;CUDA kernels;lightweight energy model;massively parallel HPC;GPU-based system;SimGrid;NVIDIA GPU;Tesla M2075 GPU;Kepler K20Xm GPU;GPGPU applications;exascale machine","","","","33","","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a dynamic and growing landscape where data continue to expand, advances in Science have become intertwined with the capacity of analysis tools to effectively handle and extract valuable information from this ocean of data. In view of the exascale era of supercomputers that is rapidly approaching, it is of the utmost importance to design novel solutions that can take full advantage of the upcoming computing infrastructures. The convergence of High Performance Computing (HPC) and data-intensive analytics is key to delivering scalable High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) solutions for scientific and engineering applications. The aim of this paper is threefold: reviewing some of the most relevant challenges towards HPDA at scale, presenting a HPDA-enabled version of the Ophidia framework and validating the scalability of the proposed framework through an experimental performance evaluation carried out in the context of the Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE). The experimental results show that the proposed solution is capable of scaling over several thousand cores and hundreds of cluster nodes.

The combination of IBM POWER9 CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU, along with a fast NVLink2 interconnect and other latest technologies, pushes system performance to a new height and breaks the exascale barrier by certain measures. Due to Summit's powerful GPUs and much higher GPU–CPU ratio, offloading to accelerators becomes a requirement for any application, which intends to effectively use the system. To facilitate navigating a complex landscape of competing heterogeneous architectures, a collection of applications from a wide spectrum of scientific domains is selected for early adoption on Summit.

This paper reports on discussions and findings from two virtual “Workflows Community Summits” (January and April, 2021). The overarching goals of these workshops were to develop a view of the state of the art, identify crucial research challenges in the workflows community, articulate a vision for potential community efforts, and discuss technical approaches for realizing this vision. To this end, participants identified six broad themes: FAIR computational workflows; AI workflows; exascale challenges; APIs, interoperability, reuse, and standards; training and education; and building a workflows community.

This method is applied to four I/O questions in this paper. A total of 13 MPI programs and 15 cases, ranging from 24 to 5968 ranks, are analyzed to establish the I/O landscape from answers to the four questions. Four of the 13 programs use MPI I/O, and the behavior of their collective writes depends on the specific implementation of the MPI library used. The SGI MPT library, the prevailing MPI library for NAS systems, was found to automatically gather small writes from a large number of ranks in order to perform larger writes by a small subset of collective buffering ranks. The number of collective buffering ranks invoked by MPT depends on the Lustre stripe count and the number of nodes used for the run. A demonstration of varying the stripe count to achieve double-digit speedup of one program's I/O was presented. Another program, which concurrently opens private files by all ranks and could potentially create a heavy load on the Lustre servers, was identified. The ability to systematically characterize I/O for a large number of programs running on a supercomputer, seek I/O optimization opportunity, and identify programs that could cause a high load and instability on the filesystems is important for pursuing exascale in a real production environment.","","978-1-5090-3918-0","10.1109/ESPT.2016.005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830461","MPI I/O;POSIX I/O;Lustre;Stripe count","Internet of Things;Instruments;NASA;Libraries;Optimization;Supercomputers;Bridges","application program interfaces;message passing;parallel processing;software libraries","I/O optimization opportunity;supercomputer;Lustre servers;private files;double-digit speedup;Lustre stripe count;collective buffering ranks;NAS systems;SGI MPT library;MPI library;I/O landscape;MPI programs;I/O questions;NAS facility;NASA advanced supercomputing;high performance computing resources;per-call levels;per-file;per-rank;per-job;IOT;MPIProf;I/O characterization;HPC","","","","17","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
