Twenty healthy young adults walked on an incline treadmill with six different visual perturbation paradigms in VR (normal VR, 10°/s rotation, 20°/s rotation, 30°/s rotation, 60°/s rotation, and random speed rotation). Muscle activation of the lower extremity was measured by surface electromyography. Results showed an increased visual rotation speed induced higher vastus lateralis and lateral gastrocnemius activation. Females and males had different responses to increased visual rotation speed in vastus lateralis. Random speed rotation induced higher medial hamstring activation than constant speed rotation, in which was more pronounced in females. In conclusion, the amount of visual perturbation should be taken into consideration when developing future VR training for astronauts. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","electromyography;

In the current study, we investigated demographic correlates of engagement with emerging forms of sextech, defined here as internet-based applications, platforms, or devices used for sexual pleasure. Our web-based, demographically representative sample included 7,512 American adults aged 18–65 years, with a near-even gender split of men/women and moderate racial diversity (63% White). Participants indicated their engagement with eight forms of sextech, including six emerging forms of sexual technology (visiting erotic camming sites, participating in camming streams, teledildonic use, accessing virtual reality pornography, playing sexually explicit video games, and sexual messaging with chatbots or artificially intelligent entities) as well as two more common domains (online pornography and sexting). Participants who were younger, were men, had higher income, and were sexual minorities reported more frequent engagement with all forms of sextech assessed. Unlike prior work on pornography, religious individuals were more likely to engage with emerging sextech. Beyond online pornography (50%) and sexting (29%), visiting camming sites (18%) and playing sexually explicit video games (13%) were relatively common. Findings may contribute to the destigmatization of sextech engagement and forecast future norms in technologically-facilitated sexual behavior. © 2022 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.","","Adult; Demography; Erotica; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior; United States; adult; demography; erotica; female; human; Internet; male; sexual and gender minority; sexual behavior; United States","","","","","","","Anderson M., Kumar M., Digital divide persists even as lower-income Americans make gains in tech adoption, (2019); Barss P., The erotic engine: How pornography has powered mass communication, from Gutenberg to Google, (2010); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Sexual economics: Sex as female resource for social exchange in heterosexual interactions, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8, 4, pp. 339-363, (2004); Benotsch E.G., Snipes D.J., Martin A.M., Bull S.S., Sexting, substance use, and sexual risk behavior in young adults, Journal of Adolescent Health, 52, 3, pp. 307-313, (2013); Beutel M.E., Stobel-Richter Y., Brahler E., Sexual desire and sexual activity of men and women across their lifespans: Results from a representative German community survey, BJU International, 101, 1, pp. 76-82, (2008); Bleakley P., “500 tokens to go private”: Camgirls, cybersex and feminist entrepreneurship, Sexuality & Culture, 18, 4, pp. 892-910, (2014); Bothe B., Toth-Kiraly I., Potenza M.N., Orosz G., Demetrovics Z., High-frequency pornography use may not always be problematic, Journal of Sexual Medicine, 17, 4, pp. 793-811, (2020); Buric J., Garcia J.R., Stulhofer A., Is sexting bad for adolescent girls’ psychological well-being?

It is a process undertaken daily by nurses as they make judgements about patient care and manage complex issues as they arise. Virtual reality is an emerging technology that is increasingly being used pedagogically to teach non-technical skills including CDM, communication, situational awareness, stress management, leadership, and teamwork. Objective: The objective of this integrative review are to synthesise the research findings regarding the impact of virtual reality on clinical decision making in undergraduate nurses. Design: An integrative review using Whittemore and Knafl's framework for integrated reviews. Data sources: An extensive search was conducted of healthcare databases including CINAHL, Medline and Web of Science between 2010 and 2021 using the terms virtual reality, clinical decision and undergraduate nursing. Review methods: The initial search located 98 articles. After screening and checking for eligibility, 70 articles were critically reviewed. Eighteen studies were included in the review and were critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for qualitative papers and McMaster's Critical appraisal form for quantitative papers. Results: Research in the use of VR has demonstrated its potential to improve undergraduate nurses' critical thinking, clinical reasoning, clinical judgement and clinical decision-making skills. Students perceive these teaching modalities to be beneficial to the development of their clinical decision-making ability. There is lack of research related to the use of immersive virtual reality in developing and enhancing undergraduate nursing students' clinical decision-making skills. Conclusion: Current research on the impact of virtual reality on the development of nursing CDM has demonstrated positive results. VR is one pedagogical approach that could further assist, however, there are no identified studies that focus on its impact in developing CDM, therefore further studies are required to address this gap in the literature. © 2023 The Authors","Clinical decision-making; Integrative review; Nursing student; Undergraduate; Virtual reality","Clinical Decision-Making; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Humans; Students, Nursing; Thinking; Virtual Reality; clinical decision making; human; nursing education; nursing student; procedures; psychology; thinking; virtual reality","","","","","","","Adhikari R., Kydonaki C., Lawrie J., O'Reilly M., Ballantyne B., Whitehorn J., Paterson R., A mixed-methods feasibility study to assess the acceptability and applicability of immersive virtual reality sepsis game as an adjunct to nursing education, Nurse Educ.

Previous research has demonstrated PA-based charity fundraising events may act as a catalyst for increased motivation for PA by fulfilling basic psychological needs while providing an emotional connection to a greater good. Therefore, the current study used a behavior-change based theoretical paradigm to develop and assess the feasibility of a 12-week charity-based virtual PA program intended to increase motivation and PA adherence. Forty-three participants were enrolled in a virtual 5 K run/walk charity event that included a structured training protocol, web-based motivation resources, and charity education. Eleven participants completed the program and results indicated no differences pre- and post-participation in motivation (t(10) = 1.16, p = .14) and self-efficacy (t(10) = 0.66, p = .26), but increased scores on charity knowledge (t(9) = −2.50, p = .02). Attrition was attributed to timing, weather, and isolated nature of a solo virtual program. Participants enjoyed the structure of the program and felt the training and educational information was beneficial, but could have been more robust. Thus, in its current format, the program design lacks efficacy. Integral changes to increase program feasibility should include group programming, participant-chosen charity, and more accountability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral economics; Motivation; Physical activity;

Most clinical practicum has been substituted by skills laboratories, simulation laboratories, virtual simulation or written assignments. Nursing students who have experienced this change in practicum have fears about their future role as new graduate nurses. However, to date, no studies have been conducted exploring how their fears work when they become new graduate nurses. Objectives: To investigate the status of nursing practicum at nursing universities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the relationship between difficulties in nursing tasks, work readiness, reality shock, and organizational socialization among new graduate nurses with nursing practicum experience during this pandemic. Design: Descriptive comparative research design. Participants: 178 new graduate nurses with a clinical experience from 1 month to less than 12 months and graduating from nursing universities in 2021, the 3rd grade in 2020 and the 4th grade in 2021. Methods: Cross-sectional study via a self-administered online questionnaire measuring difficulties in nursing tasks, work readiness, reality shock, and organizational socialization. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, Pearson correlation. Results: New graduate nurses were divided into 72 in the Clinical/Clinical group and 106 in the Clinical/Substitute group. There was a significant difference in the difficulties in nursing tasks (t = −2.342, p = .020), but there were no significant differences in work readiness, reality shock, and organizational socialization between the two groups. Conclusions: Efforts in the clinical field to increase the adaptation of new graduate nurses could prevent problems that may arise due to the restrictions and absence of clinical practicum. Discussions should be continued to develop and implement efficient nursing practicum education that not only can reduce the gap between nursing education and nursing practice, but also respond appropriately to any pandemic situation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Nursing education; Nursing students; Socialization","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Humans; Pandemics; Students, Nursing; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; nursing education; nursing student; pandemic","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021R1A2C2006359); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government ( MSIT ) (No. 2021R1A2C2006359 ).

Suicide is a major cause of preventable death worldwide. Adequate training in risk assessment and intervention is key to suicide prevention. The use of simulation (role plays, simulated patients, virtual reality…) for practical training is a promising tool in mental health. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of simulation training in suicide risk assessment and intervention for healthcare professionals and gatekeepers. Methods. We conducted a systematic review in Medline and PsycINFO up to 31 July 2021 of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials, and pre/post-test studies. RCTs were furthermore included in a meta-analysis. We assessed the methodological quality of all studies with the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 for RCTs. Primary outcomes were changes in Kirkpatrick criteria: attitudes, skills, knowledge, behaviors, and patient outcomes. Results. We included 96 articles representing 43,656 participants. Most pre/post-test (n = 65) and non-randomized controlled (n = 14) studies showed significant improvement in attitudes, skills, knowledge, and behaviors. The meta-analysis of 11 RCTs showed positive changes in attitudes immediately after training and at 2–4 months post-training; in self-perceived skills at 6 months post-training; but not in factual knowledge. Studies assessing benefits for patients are still limited. Conclusions. The heterogeneity of methodological designs, interventions, and trained populations combined with a limited number of RCTs and studies on patients’ outcomes limit the strength of the evidence. However, preliminary findings suggest that simulation is promising for practical training in suicidal crisis intervention and should be further studied. © 2023 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice field, as a self-learning medium for non-face-to-face skill training during the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19). Accordingly, this study was conducted to assess 360° VR self-learning media for a periodontal instrument operation. Materials and Methods: We recruited 30 participants who had never experienced instrument training. We offered basic education and initial assessment (IA), then divided them into three groups: 1) PAPER: trained only with paper handouts; 2) 2D: trained with 2D video; 3) VR: trained with 360° VR. Each group performed self-learning and mid-term assessment (MA). Subjects then implemented home self-learning with the same media for one week, which was then followed by a final assessment (FA). Result: Analysis of IA-to-FA improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher than the PAPER groups. Meanwhile, analysis of MA-to-FA improvement scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER group. Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different, VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score analyses. Discussion: Both 2D video and 360° VR training were helpful to participants for an effective self-learning and also had good portability and accessibility as online-based learning methods. 360° VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video, possibly due to its autonomy, 360° visual information and physical and immersive characteristics, which positively affected self-training. Conclusion: Our findings showed the potential of 360° VR learning media and, further, suggest its usefulness as a novel self-learning method in future dental education. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Students who receive disease-specific sensitivity training are more compassionate to patients. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) sensitivity training includes deficit-focused dementia tours that physically alter sensations. This embedded-experimental (between-subjects) variant mixed-methods study assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality as a delivery format for dementia tours compared to dementia tours that physically alter sensations. It also compared the effectiveness of deficit-focused dementia sensitivity training to reading strengths-focused case studies, a traditional instruction method. Forty-one university students were randomized into one of three conditions. All participants completed pre- and post-assessments and were interviewed. Quantitative results indicate that a dementia tour offered through virtual reality is as effective as a physical-based tour; however, compared to reading case studies, participants reported poorer attitudes about living with AD and feeling less prepared for caregiving. The qualitative results show an increase in empathy across all conditions. Integration of findings indicates that dementia tours in both formats are effective at encouraging empathy and that both strengths-based and deficit-based sensitivity training are important components of education for future health care workers. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Alzheimer’s disease;

Neurosurgeons have to spend plenty of time mastering the nuances of the autopsy. However, the laboratory that can meet the requirements of neurosurgery microanatomy is only owned by several large medical colleges because it is an expensive affair. Thus, laboratories worldwide are searching for substitutes,but the reality and local details might not meet the exact requirements of the anatomical structure. Herein, we compared the traditional teaching mode, the 3D image generated by the current advanced hand-held scanner and our self-developed 2D image fitting 3D imaging method in the comparative study of neuroanatomy education. Methods: To examine the efficacy of two-dimensional fitting three-dimensional imaging techniques in neuroanatomy education. 60 clinical students of grade 2020 in Wannan Medical College were randomly divided into traditional teaching group, hand held scanner 3D imaging group and 2D fitting 3D method group, with 20 students in each group.First, the modeling images of the hand held scanner 3D imaging group and the 2D fitting 3D method group are analyzed and compared, and then the teaching results of the three groups are evaluated by objective and subjective evaluation methods. The objective evaluation is in the form of examination papers, unified proposition and unified score; The subjective evaluation is conducted in the form of questionnaires to evaluate. Results: The modeling and image analysis of the current advanced hand-held 3D imaging scanner and our self-developed 2D fitting 3D imaging method were compared.The images (equivalent to 1, 10, and 40 × magnification) of the model points and polygons using the Cinema 4D R19 virtual camera of 50, 500, and 2000 mm showed 1,249,955 points and 2,500,122 polygons in the skull data obtained using the hand-held scanner. The 3D model data of the skull consisted of 499,914 points, while the number of polygons reached up to 60,000,000, which was about fourfold that of the hand-held 3D scanning. This model used 8 K mapping technology, and hand-held scanner 3D imaging 3D scanning modeling used a 0.13 K map based on the map data, thereby indicating that the 2D fitting 3D imaging method is delicate and real. Comparative analysis of general data of three groups of students.The comparison of test results, clinical practice assessment and teaching satisfaction of the three groups shows that the performance of hand held scanner 3D imaging group is better than that of traditional teaching group (P < 0.01), and that of 2D fitting 3D method group is significantly better than that of traditional teaching group (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The method used in this study can achieve real reduction. Compared to hand-held scanning, this method is more cost-effective than the cost of the equipment and the results. Moreover, the post-processing is easy to master, and the autopsy can be performed easily after learning, negating the need to seek professional help. It has a wide application prospect in teaching. © 2023, The Author(s).","Hand-held scanner 3D imaging techniques; Neuroanatomic education; Two-dimensional three-dimensional techniques; Virtual reality","Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Learning; Neuroanatomy; education; educational status; human; learning; neuroanatomy; three-dimensional imaging","","","","","Anhui Provincial Key Teaching Research Project, (2021jyxm1635); Clinical Skills Training Center; Collegiate Major Natural Science Research Projects, Anhui Province, (2022AH040178); Wannan Medical College, WNMC, (2020jyxm76, 2021jyxm03)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by The teaching quality and teaching reform project of Wannan Medical College (Grant No. 2020jyxm76 and 2021jyxm03) and Anhui Provincial Key Teaching Research Project (Grant No. 2021jyxm1635) and the Collegiate Major Natural Science Research Projects, Anhui Province, China (Grant No. 2022AH040178) provided design and technical support. ; Funding text 2: We acknowledge support by Clinical Skills Training Center, Wannan Medical College.

Similarly, virtual reality (VR) simulators have demonstrated their effectiveness in fostering surgical skill acquisition and provide a promising, realistic environment for spaced training. To explore how spacing impacts VR simulator-based acquisition of surgical psychomotor skills, we performed a systematic literature review. Methods: We systematically searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, ERIC and CINAHL for studies investigating the influence of spacing on the effectiveness of VR simulator training focused on psychomotor skill acquisition in healthcare professionals. We assessed the quality of all included studies using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias assessment tool. We extracted and aggregated qualitative data regarding spacing interval, psychomotor task performance and several other performance metrics. Results: The searches yielded 1662 unique publications. After screening the titles and abstracts, 53 publications were retained for full text screening and 7 met the inclusion criteria. Spaced training resulted in better performance scores and faster skill acquisition when compared to control groups with a single day (massed) training session. Spacing across consecutive days seemed more effective than shorter or longer spacing intervals. However, the included studies were too heterogeneous in terms of spacing interval, obtained performance metrics and psychomotor skills analysed to allow for a meta-analysis to substantiate our outcomes. Conclusion: Spacing in VR simulator-based surgical training improved skill acquisition when compared to massed training. The overall number and quality of available studies were only moderate, limiting the validity and generalizability of our findings. © 2023, The Author(s).","Medical education; Psychomotor skill; Spaced training; Surgical training; Virtual reality","Clinical Competence; Humans; Motor Skills; Psychomotor Performance; Simulation Training; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; clinical competence; computer interface; human; meta analysis; motor performance; procedures; psychomotor performance; simulation training; virtual reality","","","","","","","Connor E.V., Raker C., Wohlrab K.J., Effects of repetition and inactivity on laparoscopic skills training, J Minim Invasive Gynecol, 23, 2, pp. 194-197, (2016); Ericsson K.A., Deliberate practice and the acquisition and maintenance of expert performance in medicine and related domains, Acad Med J Assoc Am Med Coll, 79, pp. S70-S81, (2004); Gallagher A.G., Ritter E.M., Champion H., Et al., Virtual reality simulation for the operating room: proficiency-based training as a paradigm shift in surgical skills training, Ann Surg, 241, 2, pp. 364-372, (2005); Thijssen A.S., Schijven M.P., Contemporary virtual reality laparoscopy simulators: quicksand or solid grounds for assessing surgical trainees?, Am J Surg, 199, 4, pp. 529-541, (2010); Verdaasdonk E.G.G., Dankelman J., Lange J.F., Stassen L.P.S., Transfer validity of laparoscopic knot-tying training on a VR simulator to a realistic environment: a randomized controlled trial, Surg Endosc, 22, 7, pp. 1636-1642, (2008); Sinitsky D.M., Fernando B., Berlingieri P., Establishing a curriculum for the acquisition of laparoscopic psychomotor skills in the virtual reality environment, Am J Surg, 204, 3, pp. 367-376.e1, (2012); McGaghie W.C., Issenberg S.B., Cohen E.R., Barsuk J.H., Wayne D.B., Does simulation-based medical education with deliberate practice yield better results than traditional clinical education?

This technology is increasingly used in the training of healthcare professionals, and previous studies show that the involvement and motivation of students who participate in activities that use VR increases compared to those who undergo training with the traditional methodology. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the learning curve of the students using a VR environment, to evaluate the satisfaction with the training activity and the cost, and to compare them with training that uses role-playing methodology. Methodology: Two-arm community-based randomised trial. The control arm will base the training on the usual role-playing methodology. The second arm or intervention arm will base the Basic Life Support (BLS) training on a VR programme. Results: Statistically significant differences are observed in the percentage of correct answers in favour of the group that used VR as a learning methodology in the test taken at the end of the course. These differences disappear when comparing the results of the test performed at six months. The satisfaction rating of the role-playing training activity has a score of 9.37 out of a total of 10 and satisfaction with the VR methodology has a score of 9.72. The cost analysis shows that the cost of training a student by role-playing is 32.5 euros and, if trained by VR, it is 41.6 euros. Conclusions: VR is a tool that allows the consolidation of a greater amount of knowledge in the short term and can be used for situations such as pandemics, where traditional formats are not available. In relation to student satisfaction with the training activity, the rating in both groups is very high and the differences are minimal. The results will be directly applicable to the decision making of BLS training in Central Catalonia in relation to the scheduling of training activities that use the VR methodology in an uncertain environment. © 2023, The Author(s).","Learning; Primary Care; Resuscitation; Teaching; Virtual Reality","Health Personnel; Humans; Internet; Learning Curve; Motivation; Virtual Reality; controlled study; education; health care personnel; human; Internet; learning curve; motivation; randomized controlled trial; virtual reality","","","","","","","Argyris C., Schon D.A., Organizational learning II: theory, method and practice, (1996); Davenport T., Prusak L., Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know, (1998); Kyndt E., Vermeire E., Cabus S., Informal workplace learning among nurses: Organisational learning conditions and personal characteristics that predict learning outcomes, J Work Learn, 12, 28, pp. 435-450, (2016); Riera Claret C., Aprenentatge entre iguals i aprenentatge informal a l’organització.

Second Life® is a virtual world shown to provide a safe, convenient, and effective environment for teaching health-related content. To date, there has been no comprehensive review of studies using Second Life in education about Alzheimer’s Disease. The authors conducted a scoping review of the literature on the use of Second Life in the education of medical, nursing, and health professions students about Alzheimer’s Disease. Searches were conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL. Thirty-two studies containing outcomes of the application of virtual reality and the virtual world Second Life were identified. Studies were classified using the Kirkpatrick Four-Level Training Evaluation Model. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and confidence (Level 2), were most commonly reported, followed by positive reactions (Level 1). No studies identified system-level results and few examined changes in behavior. While results indicate positive student reactions and enhanced learning from Second Life interventions related to Alzheimer’s Disease, they also highlight a need for future research examining outcomes at the higher Kirkpatrick levels. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Alzheimer’s Disease; Health professions education; second life","Alzheimer Disease; Clinical Competence; Geriatrics; Health Personnel; Humans; Students, Health Occupations; Alzheimer disease; clinical competence; education; geriatrics; health care personnel; health student; human","","","","","","","Aebersold M., Tschannen D., Stephens M., Anderson P., Lei X., Second life®: A new strategy in educating nursing students, Clinical Simulation in Nursing, 8, 9, pp. e469-e475, (2012); Alzheimer’s disease facts and figures, (2019); Benham-Hutchins M., Lall M.P., Perception of nursing education uses of second life by graduate nursing students, Computers, Informatics, Nursing, 33, 9, pp. 404-409, (2015); Berger M., Jucker A.H., Locher M.A., Interaction and space in the virtual world of second life, Journal of Pragmatics, 101, pp. 83-100, (2016); Conradi E., Kavia S., Burden D., Rice A., Woodham L., Beaumont C., Poulton T., Virtual patients in a virtual world: Training paramedic students for practice, Medical Teacher, 31, 8, pp. 713-720, (2009); Danforth D.R., Procter M., Chen R., Johnson M., Heller R., Development of virtual patient simulations for medical education, Journal of Virtual Worlds Research, 2, 2, (2009); Dyer E., Swartzlander B.J., Gugliucci M.R., Using virtual reality in medical education to teach empathy, Journal of the Medical Library Association, 106, 4, pp. 498-500, (2018); Foronda C., Lippincott C., Gattamorta K., Evaluation of virtual simulation in a Master’s-Level nurse education certificate program, Computers, Informatics, Nursing, 32, 11, pp. 516-522, (2014); Gaddis T., Using virtual reality to bring your instruction to life, League for Innovation Conference on Information Technology, (1997); Gajnakova M., Vaculik J., Vasko M., The use of multi-user virtual environments in the field of education, (2010); Ghanbarzadeh R., Ghapanchi A.H., Blumenstein M., Talaei-Khoei A., A decade of research on the use of three-dimensional virtual worlds in health care: A systematic literature review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16, 2, (2014); Gilmartin-Thomas J.F., Duncan G., Educating students about dementia with virtual-learning experiences, American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, 74, 13, pp. 956-957, (2017); Gilmartin-Thomas J.F., McNeil J., Powell A., Malone D.T., Larson I.C., O'Reilly C.L., Bell J.S., Qualitative evaluation of how a virtual dementia experience impacts medical and pharmacy students’ self-reported knowledge and attitudes towards people with dementia, Dementia, (2018); Gustafsson M., Englund C., Gallego G., The description and evaluation of virtual worlds in clinical pharmacy education in Northern Sweden, Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning, 9, 5, pp. 887-892, (2017); Guze P.A., Using technology to meet the challenges of medical education, Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association, 126, pp. 260-270, (2015); Hermanns M., Kilmon C., Second life® as a clinical conference environment: Experience of students and faculty, Clinical Simulation In Nursing, 8, 7, pp. e297-e300, (2012); Huang G., Reynolds R., Candler C., Virtual patient simulation at U.S. and Canadian medical schools, Academic Medicine, 82, 5, pp. 446-451, (2007); Committee on the future health care workforce for older Americans.

Materials and Methods: Forty subjects from mild-to-moderate PD stages, with no cognitive impairment were submitted to one session of NPT, one session of AR, and one session of VR for 50 minutes each (7 days interval between them). PC was evaluated before and after each therapy, using force platform in bipedal positions: tandem with eyes opened (EO), eyes closed (EC), and with double-task and one-legged stance. We recorded the center of pressure area, and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) displacement amplitude and velocity. EF was assessed by Trail Making Test (TMT). Results: PC improved (pre- vs. postintervention) after the three modalities: AP velocity decreased after AR (tandem EC 2.3 [1.7 to 2.9] vs. 2.1 [1.5 to 2.9], one-legged 3.0 [1.9 to 4.0] vs. 2.9 [1.9 to 3.6]), NPT (tandem EC 2.2 [1.7 to 3.1] vs. 2.1 [1.6 to 3.0]), and VR (tandem EO 1.9 [1.4 to 2.6] vs. 1.8 [1.4 to 2.4], tandem EC 2.3 [1.6 to 3.0] vs. 2.0 [1.5 to 2.8]); ML velocity decreased after AR in one-legged (P = 0.04); and permanence time in one-legged position increased in AR (Δ: 2.5 [-0.2 to 6.9]). There was also improvement in EF: TMT part A (TMTA)'s time decreased after AR (-9.3 [-15.7 to 1.9]), and TMT part B (TMTB)'s time decreased after the three modalities (ΔNPT: -7.7 [-29.4 to 0.0] vs. ΔAR: -4.6 [-34.6 to 0.6] vs. ΔVR: -4.9 [-28.2 to 0.9]). There were no differences between the modalities. Conclusion: The three treatment modalities improved PC and EF of subjects with PD. Moreover, AR and VR generated similar immediate effects to NPT on both outcomes in these patients.

However, the details of how human drivers and pedestrians interact at unsignalised crossings remain poorly understood. We addressed some aspects of this challenge by replicating vehicle–pedestrian interactions in a safe and controlled virtual environment by connecting a high fidelity motion-based driving simulator to a CAVE-based pedestrian lab in which 64 participants (32 pairs of one driver and one pedestrian) interacted with each other under different scenarios. The controlled setting helped us study the causal role of kinematics and priority rules on interaction outcome and behaviour, something that is not possible in naturalistic studies. We also found that kinematic cues played a stronger role than psychological traits like sensation seeking and social value orientation in determining whether the pedestrian or driver passed first at unmarked crossings. One main contribution of this study is our experimental paradigm, which permitted repeated observation of crossing interactions by each driver-pedestrian participant pair, yielding behaviours which were qualitatively in line with observations from naturalistic studies. © 2023 The Authors","Autonomous Vehicles; Gap acceptance; Mixed-effects model; Traffic psychology; Zebra crossing","Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Humans; Motion; Pedestrians; Safety; Walking; Autonomous vehicles; Pedestrian safety; Virtual reality; 'current; Automated vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Gap-acceptance; Human drivers; Mixed effects models; Naturalistic study; Pedestrian behavior; Traffic psychology; Zebra crossing; car driving; human; motion; pedestrian; prevention and control; psychology; safety; traffic accident; walking; Kinematics","","","","","European Commission's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, (860410); Innovate UK, (TS/P012035/1)","The study was carried out as part of the SHAPE-IT project, receiving funding from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (Grant agreement 860410) and the HumanDrive project, funded by Innovate UK and the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (TS/P012035/1).

To increase risk perceptions and promote preventive behaviors against vaping and secondhand e-cigarette aerosol (SHA), this study designed and tested virtual reality (VR) messages based on the theory of psychological distance. We randomly assigned 137 participants to see one of three messages: a VR message presenting SHAs impact on the self (VR-Self), a VR message showing SHAs impact on others (VR-Other), and a print advertisement. Risk perceptions and preventive intentions/behaviors were assessed at three different times: before, immediately after, and 1 week after the experimental treatment. All three messages increased desired intentions and risk perceptions immediately, reduced vaping interest both immediately and 1 week after message exposure, and increased behavior to persuade others to quit vaping after a week. Compared with the print advertisement, VR-Other generated less vaping interest immediately following message exposure (β = 1.40, p = 0.05). After 1 week, VR-Self (β = 1.62, p = 0.05) and VR-Other (β = 2.37, p = 0.01) generated less vaping interest than the print advertisement. VR-Other also generated a higher level of perceived harm of SHA (β = 1.27, p = 0.01) than the print advertisement. VRs advantage over print in reducing vaping interest was increased after 1 week. Although VR-Other generated less emotions, such as fear, than VR-Self (z = 2.48, p = 0.02) and print (z = -2.82, p = 0.02), its persuasiveness was not hindered. Disgust increased the intentions to persuade others to quit vaping immediately after the experimental treatment (β = 0.85, p = 0.02), and anger aroused by recalling the messages decreased vaping interest 1 week later (β = -2.07, p = 0.02).  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","campaign; e-cigarette; emotions; psychological distance; vaping; virtual reality","Aerosols; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Emotions; Humans; Vaping; Virtual Reality; Young Adult; aerosol; electronic cigarette; emotion; human; prevention and control; vaping; virtual reality; young adult","","Aerosols, ","","","","","Vaping & Cannabis Trends among Young Adults 2020; King BA, Alam S, Promoff G, Et al., Awareness and everuse of electronic cigarettes among U.S. adults, 2010-2011, Nicotine Tob Res, 15, (2013); Quick Facts on the Risks of E-cigarettes for Kids, Teens, and Young Adults, (2022); Gentzke AS, Wang TW, Marynak KL, Et al., Exposure to secondhand smoke and secondhand e-cigarette aerosol among middle and high school students, Prev Chronic Dis, 16, (2019); Islam T, Braymiller J, Eckel SP, Et al., Secondhand nicotine vaping at home and respiratory symptoms in young adults, Thorax, (2022); Tsai J, Walton K, Coleman BN, Et al., Reasons for electronic cigarette use among middle and high school students ""National Youth Tobacco Survey, United States, 2016, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 67, (2018); Paek HJ, Kim S, Hove T, Et al., Reduced harm or another gateway to smoking Source, message, and information characteristics of E-cigarette videos on YouTube, J Health Commun, 19, (2014); Willis E, Haught MJ, Morris DL., Up in vapor: Exploring the health messages of E-cigarette advertisements, Health Commun, 32, (2017); Schaeffer K., Before recent outbreak, vaping was on the rise in U.S., especially among young people, Pew Research Center, (2019); Lee SJ., The role of construal level in message effects research: A review and future directions, Commun Theory, 29, (2019); Trope Y, Liberman N., Construal-level theory of psychological distance, Psychol Rev, 117, pp. 440-463, (2010); Spence A, Poortinga W, Pidgeon N., The psychological distance of climate change, Risk Anal, 32, (2012); Ahn SJ, Incorporating immersive virtual environments in health promotion campaigns: A construal level theory approach, Health Commun, (2015); Ahn SJ, Le AMT, Bailenson J., The effect of embodied experiences on self-other merging, attitude, and helping behavior, Media Psychol, 16, (2013); Choi DH, Noh GY., The effect of presence in virtual reality video on handwashing intention, Asian J Commun, 30, (2020); Meijers MHC, Smit ES, de Wildt K, Et al., Stimulating sustainable food choices using virtual reality: Taking an environmental vs health communication perspective on enhancing response efficacy beliefs, Environ Commun, 16, (2022); Ahn SJ, Bailenson JN, Park D., Short-and long-term effects of embodied experiences in immersive virtual environments on environmental locus of control and behavior, Comput Human Behav, 39, (2014); Knight J, Chapman S., Asian yuppies.are always looking for something new and different (tm): Creating a tobacco culture among young Asians, Tobacco Control, (2004); Chang C., Enhancing the effectiveness of antismoking messages via self-congruent appeals, Health Commun, 24, (2009); Van Boven L, Kane J, McGraw AP, Et al., Feeling close: Emotional intensity reduces perceived psychological distance, J Pers Soc Psychol, 98, (2010); Ayduk O, Kross E., Enhancing the pace of recovery: Selfdistanced analysis of negative experiences reduces blood pressure reactivity: Short report, Psychol Sci, 19, (2008); Felnhofer A, Kothgassner OD, Schmidt M, Et al., Is virtual reality emotionally arousing?

Virtual reality potentially provides a safe and ecologically valid approach to training since it offers a near-to-real visual experience, together with the opportunity to practice task-related skills and receive feedback. As a prelude to the development of a training intervention, the aim of this research was to establish the construct validity of virtual reality drowning detection tasks. Method: Using a repeated measures design, a total of 38 qualified lifeguards and 33 non-lifeguards completed 13 min and 23 min simulated drowning detection tasks that were intended to reflect different levels of sustained attention. During the simulated tasks, participants were asked to monitor a virtual pool and identify any drowning targets with accuracy, response latency, and dwell time recorded. Results: During the simulated scenarios, pool lifeguards detected drowning targets more frequently and spent less time than non-lifeguards fixating on the drowning target prior to the drowning onset. No significant differences in response latency were evident between lifeguards and non-lifeguards nor for first fixations on the drowning target. Conclusion: The results provide support for the construct validity of virtual reality lifeguarding scenarios, thereby providing the basis for their development and introduction as a potential training approach for developing and maintaining performance in lifeguarding and drowning detection. Application: This research provides support for the construct validity of virtual reality simulations as a potential training tool, enabling improvements in the fidelity of training solutions to improve pool lifeguard competency in drowning detection. © 2022 The Authors","Drowning; Lifeguards; Training simulation; Virtual reality; Visual search; Water safety","Attention; Drowning; Humans; Reaction Time; Accidents; E-learning; Lakes; Construct validity; Detection tasks; Drowning; Lifeguard; Training intervention; Training simulation; Training solutions; Visual experiences; Visual search; Water safety; adult; Article; construct validity; demographics; drowning; dwell time; ecology; employment; female; human; human experiment; lifeguarding; male; pedagogics; provocation test; questionnaire; reaction time; swimming; training; virtual reality; attention; drowning; Virtual reality","","","","","Y New South Wales, (LP160101803); Australian Research Council, ARC","This research was funded by the Australian Research Council under its Linkage Grant Scheme with support from The Y New South Wales ( LP160101803 ).","Bedir D., Erhan S.E., The effect of virtual reality technology on the imagery skills and performance of target-based sports athletes, Front.

Are virtual character spokespersons better than real celebrity spokespersons? This article aims to explore the relationships between different types of advertising spokespersons, different types of advertising scenarios, and consumers' purchase intentions. The results of 2 pilot experiments and 4 formal experiments show that compared with spokespersons by real people, virtual character spokespersons have a greater positive impact on consumers' purchase intentions, which is achieved through the mediating role of psychological need satisfaction. In addition, different advertising scenarios provided by virtual technology have a moderating effect on this process. This empirical study investigates the possible positive effects of virtual character spokesperson compared with real character spokesperson and expands the results of spokesperson category based on self-determination theory.

Virtual reality may increase access to staff training to foster empathy. Method: A mixed methods feasibility study investigated a custom-built virtual reality program, IMercyVE, which aimed to immerse a disability worker in a first-person perspective of having intellectual disability. Data were collected through online surveys (n = 9) completed before and after use of IMercyVE, and by videoconference focus groups (n = 6). Results: Qualitative findings included that IMercyVE delivered a novel experience for participants and a distinctive mode of learning that assisted participants to deepen their levels of empathy. Descriptive analyses of the surveys indicated that participants' empathy increased after engaging with IMercyVE. Conclusions: IMercyVE has the potential to be offered as a remotely delivered and flexible staff training modality suitable for building empathy. Further research with a larger sample is warranted. © 2022 The Authors.

However, decades of research have primarily measured the fidelity of cognitive maps after discrete, controlled learning episodes. We know little about how cognitive maps are formed during naturalistic free exploration. Here, we investigated whether exploration trajectories predicted cognitive map accuracy, and how these patterns were shaped by environmental structure. In two experiments, participants freely explored a previously unfamiliar virtual environment. We related their exploration trajectories to a measure of how long they spent in areas with high global environmental connectivity (integration, as assessed by space syntax). In both experiments, we found that participants who spent more time on paths that offered opportunities for integration formed more accurate cognitive maps. Interestingly, we found no support for our pre-registered hypothesis that self-reported trait differences in navigation ability would mediate this relationship. Our findings suggest that exploration patterns predict cognitive map accuracy, even for people who self-report low ability, and highlight the importance of considering both environmental structure and individual variability in formal theory- and model-building. © 2022","Cognitive map; Environmental structure; Exploration; Roaming; Space syntax; Spatial navigation; Virtual reality","Cognition; Humans; Learning; Space Perception; Spatial Navigation; adult; article; cognitive map; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; self report; spatial orientation; theoretical study; virtual reality; cognition; depth perception; learning","","","","","Alexia Galati; Marianna Pagkratidou; National Science Foundation, NSF, (EHR 1660996); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 EY031286); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: This research was supported by a Discovery grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council to J.E.S.

Background: A range of educational and other theories are used to support nursing and midwifery education, including when e-learning interventions are being designed and delivered. However, there is a limited understanding of how theory is applied across the wide range of digital learning interventions to inform pedagogical research and practice. Design: A systematic review. Methods: CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE and PubMed were searched using key terms. Studies were screened by independent reviewers checking the title, abstract and full text against eligibility criteria. Due to the theoretical focus of the review, critical appraisal was not undertaken. Data were extracted and synthesised using a descriptive approach. Results: Thirty-four studies were included. Twenty theories were identified from a range of scientific disciplines, with the Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Self-Efficacy employed most often. Theoretical frameworks were used to inform and explain how the digital learning interventions were designed or implemented in nursing and midwifery education. The sample were mainly undergraduate nursing students and the digital learning interventions encompassed animation, blended approaches, general technologies, mobile, online, virtual simulation and virtual reality applications which were used mainly in university settings. Conclusions: This systematic review found a range of theories that support the design and delivery on digital learning interventions in nursing and midwifery education. While a single theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, tended to dominate the literature, the evidence base is peppered with numerous theoretical models that need to be examined more rigorously to ascertain their utility in improving the design or implementation of digital forms of learning to improve pedagogical research and practice in nursing and midwifery. © 2023 The Authors","E-learning; Education; Framework; M-learning; Midwifery; Nursing; Simulation; Theoretical model","Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Nursing; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Humans; Learning; Midwifery; Pregnancy; Students, Nursing; Cinahl; conceptual framework; e-learning; education; eligibility criteria; human; human experiment; learning; Medline; midwife; midwifery education; mobile learning; nursing student; review; self concept; simulation; systematic review; theoretical study; virtual reality; education; female; learning; nursing education; pregnancy; teaching","","","","","","","Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action control: From cognition to behavior, pp. 11-39, (1985); Babenko-Mould Y., andrusyszyn M.A., Goldenberg D., Effects of computer-based clinical conferencing on nursing students’ self-efficacy, J.

In this study, we have employed virtual reality (VR) and scenario-based interviews to examine the trust of pedestrians toward AVs, based on the attributes of trust and trustworthiness. A hybrid approach of inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the responses of 36 participants was undertaken. Eight such attributes emerged from the analysis, including statistical reliability and dependability, competence, predictability, familiarity, authority/subversion, liberty/oppression, care/harm, and sanctity/degradation. The first four are objective attributes concerning automation trustworthiness and human trust in automation, while the remaining four are subjective attributes, analogous to properties of human morality. The findings of this study provide an empirical grounding for trust theories. Specifically, we have highlighted the importance of subjective qualities in constituting pedestrian-AV trust, including “automation morality” and “care/harm”. © 2023","Attributes of trust; Automated vehicles; Qualitative analysis","Accidents, Traffic; Automation; Autonomous Vehicles; Humans; Pedestrians; Reproducibility of Results; Trust; Pedestrian safety; Reliability analysis; Vehicles; Virtual reality; 'current; Attribute of trust; Automated vehicles; Hybrid approach; Low-level attributes; Qualitative analysis; Qualitative study; Scenario-based; Thematic analysis; Trust and trustworthiness; adult; article; automation; clinical article; female; human; human experiment; interview; male; morality; pedestrian; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; reliability; thematic analysis; trust; virtual reality; prevention and control; reproducibility; traffic accident; Automation","","","","","Key Technological Innovation Program of Ningbo City, (2022Z080); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (202101042006)","This work was supported by the Chinese Ergonomics Society Fund of the Chinese Ministry of Education [grant number 202101042006 ] and the 2025 Key Technological Innovation Program of Ningbo City [grant number 2022Z080 ].

We conducted an experiment using a 2 × 2 factorial design with 124 participants who were randomly assigned to either a neutral or negative prior mood condition, and an interactive or noninteractive joy induction condition. Prior mood was experimentally manipulated using a VR scenario that simulated a terror attack at a train station (negative mood condition) compared with a control condition in which no incidents occurred at the train station (neutral mood condition). Subsequently, participants entered a virtual park scenario that either allowed for playful interaction with objects in the park (interactive condition) or not (noninteractive condition). We found that interactive VR experiences lead to lower levels of negative affect compared with a noninteractive experience irrespective of participants' prior mood, but playful interaction in VR only increased joy when participants were in a neutral (not negative) prior mood. We suggest interactivity as a design principle for effective negative mood reduction, but further research is required on how to successfully transform a prior negative mood into joy.  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","affect induction procedures; exposure to terrorism; interactivity; joy; virtual reality","Affect; Humans; Virtual Reality; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy; adult; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; factorial design; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mood; randomized controlled trial; simulation; terrorism; virtual reality; affect; virtual reality exposure therapy","","","","","Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (594/15); University of Haifa","This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (D.C., grant no. 594/15) and the Center for Cyber Law & Policy at the University of Haifa, in conjunction with the Israel National Cyber Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office.

It is extremely common, and it poses a major risk to human health. Technological solutions including social media, robots, and virtual reality have been advocated and implemented to relieve loneliness, and their use will undoubtedly increase in the near future. This paper explores the use of technological solutions from a normative perspective, asking whether and to what extent such measures should indeed be relied upon. The conclusion is that technological solutions are unquestionably part of the solution to loneliness, but that they cannot and should not constitute the whole solution. It is important to note that this is not a straw-man argument, as several organizations and scholars have strictly focused on such technological solutions for loneliness. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","loneliness; responsibility; social media; technology; virtual reality","COVID-19; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Public Health; Technology; human; loneliness; pandemic; public health; technology","","","","","","","","Z.

However, there seems to be no consensus on the improvement and comparison of physical function, balance and falls in elderly people with balance impairment. Objective: This study aims to explore the effects of VR intervention on physical function, balance and falls in elderly people with balance impairment. Methods: Systematic literature searches of the PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier, Cochrane, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were performed for VR games-related randomized controlled trials or comparison studies among elderly participants with impaired balance, published in English or Chinese until March 20, 2022. The Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the standardized mean deviation or mean difference of the sample and its 95% confidence interval (CI) in VR games. Results: The systematic review included 23 studies. The results showed that VR intervention had significant effects on hand grip strength (MD:1.30, P = 0.040), knee extension strength (MD:-6.27, P<0.001), five times sit-to-stand test scores (MD:1.13, P = 0.030), timed up-and-go test scores (MD:-1.01, P = 0.001), berg balance scale scores (MD:2.37, P<0.001), and falls efficacy scale scores (SMD:-0.28, P = 0.020). Subgroup analysis results showed that VR intervention was more effective on improving TUG and BBS scores than the conventional exercise group (MD=-0.54, P = 0.004; MD=3.24, P<0.001) and the non-intervention group (MD=-0.98, P = 0.001; MD=3.30, P < 0.001). The balance training-based VR had a significant effect on improving TUG (MD=-1.03, P = 0.004) and BBS (MD=2.93, P<0.001), and 20–45 min intervention, ≥3 times/wk, 5–8 wk cycles were significant in improving TUG (MD=-0.89, P<0.001; MD=-0.75, P = 0.0003; MD=-1.54, P<0.0001). VR intervention significantly improved TUG (MD=-2.27, P<0.0001) and BBS (MD=3.41, P<0.0001) in older adults in the hospital or nursing home compared with those residing in communities. Conclusion: VR interventions can help the elderly with impaired balance to overcome traditional sports obstacles and improve physical function, balance and minimize falls. Balance training-based VR intervention is more effective in balance recovery and fall prevention compared with game program. An intervention plan comprising 20–45 min, 5–8 wk cycles, and ≥3 times/wk frequency has significantly higher effects for high-risk elderly populations living in hospitals or nursing homes. © 2023","Balance; Fall; Old adults; Physical function; VR interventions","Accidental Falls; Aged; Hand Strength; Humans; Nursing Homes; Postural Balance; Virtual Reality; aged; balance impairment; Berg Balance Scale; body equilibrium; clinical effectiveness; clinical feature; exergaming; falling; functional status; hand grip; human; intervention study; knee extension strength; motor dysfunction assessment; muscle strength; physical activity; Review; risk factor; sit to stand test; systematic review; timed up and go test; body equilibrium; hand strength; meta analysis; nursing home; prevention and control; virtual reality","","","","","Innovation Project of Postgraduate Training in Jiangsu Province Bureau, (KYCX21_2909)","This work was supported by the Innovation Project of Postgraduate Training in Jiangsu Province Bureau (no.

Apart from granting insights into local routines and premises, the medium should facilitate knowledge acquisition and spatial orientation depending on its design. This assumption, however, is not yet substantiated empirically. Thus, three hypotheses were tested in consideration of Mayer’s modality principle: 1) Providing 360° VR photos as visual reference improves retention and comprehension of information. 2) The annotation of text boxes in 360° VR photos compromises spatial orientation and presence. 3) Annotated audio commentary is superior to annotated text boxes in terms of cognitive load and knowledge acquisition. Methods: Using head-mounted displays, students of human (N=53) and dental medicine (N=8) completed one of three virtual tours through a surgical unit, which were created with 360° VR photos. In the first two variants, information about the facilities, medical devices and clinical procedures was annotated either as text boxes or audio commentary comprising 67 words on average (SD=6.67). In the third variant, the same information was given separately on a printed handout before the virtual tour. Taking user experience and individual learner characteristics into account, differences between conditions were measured regarding retention, comprehension, spatial orientation, cognitive load, and presence. Results: Concerning retention and comprehension of information, annotated text boxes outperformed annotated audio commentary and the handout condition. Although annotated audio commentary exhibited the lowest knowledge test scores, students preferred listening over reading. Students with an interest in VR and 360° media reported higher levels of enjoyment and presence. Regarding spatial orientation and presence, no significant group differences were found. Conclusions: 360° VR photos can convey information and a sense of spatial orientation effectively in the same learning scenario. For students, their use is both enjoyable and instructive. Unexpectedly, the ideal mode of annotation is not dictated by Mayer’s modality principle. For information like in this study, annotated text boxes are better for knowledge acquisition than the subjectively preferred audio commentary. This finding is probably contingent on the length and the quality of the annotated text. To identify boundary conditions and to validate the findings, more research is required on the design and educational use of 360° VR photos. © 2023 Speidel et al.","360° photos; 360° VR photos; annotation; learning; orientation; virtual reality","Humans; Learning; Orientation, Spatial; Virtual Reality; human; learning; spatial orientation; virtual reality","","","","","Universität Ulm, UULM","This work was supported by the committee of educational research at the Medical Faculty of Ulm University.","Shah CJ., Early clinical exposure-Why and how?, J Educ Technol Health Sci, 5, 1, pp. 2-7, (2020); Applicants, Matriculants, and Enrollment of U.S. Medical Schools, 1980-1981 through 2020-2021, (2022); Anzahl der Studierenden im Fach Humanmedizin in Deutschland nach Geschlecht in den Wintersemestern von 2007/2008 bis 2020/2021, (2021); Speidel R, Schneider A, Korner J, Grab-Kroll C, Ochsner W., Did video kill the XR star?

By expounding upon how desire, relationality, and race can be understood within technocultures, particularly within immersive interactive and virtual reality gaming, I situate the potentiality of queer worldmaking outside of the confines of social pressures and expectations in the material world. Through an analysis of Black Mirror’s episode, “Striking Vipers,” I propose three concepts for analyzing queer relationality within technocultures, technodesiring, technorelating, and technoBlackness. The article concludes with possibilities for queer relationality and queer worldmaking that extend beyond the realm of white heteropatriarchal socialities. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Queer relationality; technoBlackness; technoculture; technodesiring; technorelating","Gender Identity; Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; gender identity; human; male; sexual and gender minority","","","","","","","Abdi S., Calafell B.M., Queer utopias and a (feminist) Iranian vampire: A critical analysis of resistive monstrosity in A girl walks home alone at night, Critical Studies in Media Communication, 34, 4, pp. 358-370, (2017); Alaoui F.Z.C., Unpacking African epistemological violence: Toward critical Africanness in communication studies, Review of Communication, 21, 4, pp. 293-309, (2021); Alaoui F.Z.C., Abdi S., Wakanda for everyone: An invitation to an African Muslim perspective of Black Panther, Review of Communication, 20, 3, pp. 229-235, (2020); Asante M.K., Blackness as an ethical trope: Toward a post-Western assertion, White on White/Black on Black, pp. 203-216, (2005); Asante G.A., Hanchey J.N., African communication studies: A provocation and invitation, Review of Communication, 21, 4, pp. 271-292, (2021); Bailey M., Misogynoir transformed: Black women’s digital resistance, (2021); Butler J., Undoing gender, (2004); Cooper S., Questions concerning technoculture, Science as Culture, 19, 2, pp. 255-258, (2010); Cote A., Curate your culture: A call for social justice-oriented game development and community management, Woke gaming: Digital challenges to oppression and social injustice, pp. 193-212, (2018); Dillard C., When the ground is Black, the ground is fertile: Exploring endarkened feminist epistemology and healing methodologies of the spirit, Handbook of critical and Indigenous methodologies, pp. 277-292, (2008); Du Bois W.E.B., The souls of Black folk, (1903); Freeman E., Introduction: Queer and not now, Time binds: Queer temporalities, queer histories, pp. 1-19, (2010); Fryxell A.R.P., Artificial eye: The modernist origins of Ai’s gender problem, Discourse, 43, 1, pp. 31-64, (2021); Gilroy P., The Black Atlantic: Modernity and double consciousness, (1993); Hall S., What is this “Black” in Black popular culture?, Black popular culture, pp. 21-33, (1992); Haraway D.J., A cyborg manifesto: Science, technology, and socialist feminism in the late twentieth century, Simians, cyborgs, and women: The reinvention of nature, pp. 149-181, (1991); Henson B., Communication theory from Améfrica Ladina: Amefricanidade, Lélia Gonzalez, and Black decolonial approaches, Review of Communication, 21, 4, pp. 345-362, (2021); Ibrahim A., The rhizome of Blackness: A critical ethnography of hip-hop culture, language, identity, and the politics of becoming, (2014); Jakobsen J.R., Queer is?

Today, the rise of the Metaverse fuels a growing interest in leveraging this technology, bringing along an emerging need to better understand the way different dimensions of VEs, namely social and interactive, impact overall user experience (UX). This between-subject exploratory field study investigates differences in the perceived and lived experience of 28 participants engaging, either individually or in dyads, in a VR experience comprising different levels of interactivity, i.e., passive or active. A mixed methods approach combining conventional UX measures, i.e., psychometric surveys and user interviews, as well as psychophysiological measures, i.e., wearable bio- and motion sensors, allowed for a comprehensive assessment of users' immersive and affective experiences. Results pertaining to the social dimension of the experience reveal that shared VR elicits significantly more positive affect, whereas presence, immersion, flow, and state anxiety are unaffected by the copresence of a real-world partner. Results pertaining to the interactive dimension of the experience suggest that the interactivity afforded by the VE moderates the effect of copresence on users' adaptive immersion and arousal. These results support that VR can be shared with a real-world partner not only without hindering the immersive experience, but also by enhancing positive affect. Hence, in addition to offering methodological directions for future VR field research, this study provides interesting practical insights into guiding VR developers toward optimal multiuser virtual environments.  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","copresence; emotional arousal; immersive user experience; interactivity; multiuser virtual environments; virtual reality","Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Arousal; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality; anxiety; anxiety disorder; arousal; human; questionnaire; virtual reality","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (DDG-2020-00041)","This study was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) (Grant No. DDG-2020-00041).","Xiong J, Hsiang E-L, He Z, Et al., Augmented reality and virtual reality displays: Emerging technologies and future perspectives, Light Sci Appl, 10, 1, pp. 1-30, (2021); Shehade M, Stylianou-Lambert T., Virtual reality in museums: Exploring the experiences of museum professionals, Appl Sci, 10, 11, (2020); Riva G, Wiederhold BK., What the Metaverse is (really) and why we need to know about it, Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw, 25, 6, pp. 335-359, (2022); Mystakidis S., Metaverse, Encyclopedia, 2, 1, (2022); Markowitz DM, Laha R, Perone BP, Et al., Immersive virtual reality field trips facilitate learning about climate change, Front Psychol, 9, (2018); Carrozzino M, Bergamasco M., Beyond virtual museums: Experiencing immersive virtual reality in real museums, J Cult Herit, 11, 4, pp. 452-458, (2010); Sung EC., The effects of augmented reality mobile app advertising: Viral marketing via shared social experience, J Bus Res, 122, 75-87, (2021); Mehl MR, Pennebaker JW., The sounds of social life: A psychometric analysis of students (tm) daily social environments and natural conversations, J Pers Soc Psychol, 84, 4, (2003); Liszio S, Masuch M., Designing Shared Virtual Reality Gaming Experiences in Local Multi-Platform Games, International Conference on Entertainment Computing, 15, pp. 235-240, (2016); Moustafa F, Steed A., A longitudinal study of small group interaction in social virtual reality, 24th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology, 22, pp. 1-10, (2018); Rogers K, Funke J, Frommel J, Et al., Exploring interaction fidelity in virtual reality: Object manipulation and wholebody movements, CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 414, pp. 1-14, (2019); Zhang L, Bowman DA, Jones CN., Exploring Effects of Interactivity on Learning with Interactive Storytelling in Immersive Virtual Reality, 11th International Conference on Virtual Worlds and Games for Serious Applications (VS-Games), pp. 1-8, (2019); Witmer BG, Singer MJ., Measuring presence in virtual environments: A presence questionnaire, Presence, 7, 3, pp. 225-240, (1998); Schroeder R., Being there together and the future of connected presence, Presence, 15, 4, pp. 438-454, (2006); Cummings JJ, Bailenson JN., How immersive is enough?

Audience behavior and feedback received during a speech are a crucial variable to induce PSA, affecting performance and perception. In this study, two different virtual reality public speaking scenarios were developed to investigate the impact of positive (more assertive) versus negative (more hostile) audience behavior regarding perceived anxiety and physiological arousal during performance. Moreover, the presence of any carry-over effect based on first experiences (positive vs. negative) was investigated by using a within-between design. Both explicit (questionnaires) and implicit physiological measures (heart rate [HR]) were used to assess participants' experience. The results confirmed the influence of audience behavior on perceived anxiety. As expected, negative audience elicited greater anxiety and lower experience pleasantness. More interesting, the first experience influenced the perceived anxiety and arousal during performance, suggesting some sort of priming effect due to the valence of previous experience. In particular, starting with an encouraging feedback scenario did not increase the perceived anxiety and HR in front of a subsequent annoying audience. This modulation did not appear in the group who started with the annoying audience, which clearly reported higher HR and anxiety during the annoying exposure compared with the encouraging audience. These results are discussed considering previous evidence on the effect of feedback on performance.

Design: This was a single-blinded cross-over randomized control trial in a single tertiary Orthopedic training center. Participants: Orthopedic trainees were recruited, and each morning participants rostered to theatre were randomized to either undergo a simulated surgical procedure on a virtual reality simulation system prior to their first case as primary operator (priming arm), or to perform their usual preparatory routine for surgery (control arm). Consultant orthopedic trainers were recruited within the orthopedic unit to carry out subjective surgical performance assessments using a validated global rating scale tool on the first case the participant performed on the list as primary operator. Results: Over 3 study periods a total of 151 data points were collected, with 49 matched data points across priming status and procedural level of difficulty. Subjective assessment tools consistently demonstrated improved operative performance by participants following surgical priming (p = 0.001). Conclusion: This study highlights that introduction of preoperative priming to improve operative preparation, and optimizes operative performance. This has not only implications for improved resident training, but also signals towards beneficial downstream effects on patient outcomes, and theatre list planning. © 2022 The Author(s)","Performance; Priming; Surgical training; Warm-up","Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Education, Medical, Graduate; Humans; Internship and Residency; Simulation Training; Virtual Reality; adult; Article; consensus development; construct validity; crossover procedure; feedback system; female; fluoroscopy; handheld device; hip fracture; hospital physician; human; informed consent; knee arthroscopy; male; normal human; patient positioning; perioperative period; postoperative period; preoperative care; professional development; randomized controlled trial; resident; self evaluation; single blind procedure; surgical training; total hip replacement; total knee arthroplasty; virtual reality; warm up; work experience; clinical competence; computer simulation; controlled study; medical education; procedures; simulation training; virtual reality","","","","","","","Kneebone R.L., Performing surgery: commonalities with performers outside medicine, Front Psychol, 7, (2016); Wong N.C., The 10 000-hour rule, Can Urol Assoc J, 9, (2015); Hirschl R.B., The making of a surgeon: 10,000 hours?, J Pediatr Surg, 50, pp. 699-706, (2015); Omahen D.A., The 10,000-hour rule and residency training, CMAJ, 180, (2009); Fitzgerald J.E., Caesar B.C., The European working time Directive: a practical review for surgical trainees, Int J Surg, 10, pp. 399-403, (2012); Egan C., Elliott R., Fleming P., European Working Time Directive and the use of simulators and models in Irish orthopaedics, Ir J Med Sci, 181, pp. 143-146, (2012); Ghobrial G.M., Anderson P.A., Chitale R., Campbell P.G., Lobel D.A., Harrop J., Simulated spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak repair: an educational model with didactic and technical components, Neurosurgery, 73, pp. 111-115, (2013); Cheng A., Yuen D., Cristancho S., Rehearsal simulation for antenatal consults, Can Med Educ J, 12, pp. 105-112, (2021); Yau S.Y., Chang Y.C., Wu M.Y., Liao S.C., Does seniority always correlate with simulated intubation performance?

The closure of universities, the restrictions imposed, and the reduction of social activities led to considerable changes in students' lives, thus posing new mental health and emotional challenges. Within this context, promoting university students' general well-being, in particular emotional and psychological well-being, becomes essential. In addition to the possibility of online interventions aimed at overcoming distance limitations and reaching people at their home, other advanced technologies such as virtual reality (VR) have demonstrated the potential to improve people's well-being, quality of life, and positive experiences. The study reported in this article is aimed at exploring the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a self-help VR intervention lasting 3 weeks in promoting emotional well-being in university students. Forty-two university students voluntarily participated in a six-session intervention. In each session, a different virtual scenario was presented: two relaxing experiences and four transformative experiences based on metaphors or metaphoric ones aimed at encouraging students to be aware of their emotions and positive resources. Students were randomly allocated to an experimental group and to a waiting list group that started the intervention after 3 weeks. Before and after the six sessions, participants completed an assessment by completing online questionnaires. Results showed a significant increase in both emotional well-being and psychological well-being in the experimental group compared to the waiting list group.

While discussions on converting the leftover space into pedestrian-friendly alternatives exist, allocating that limited space to which alternative is foreseen to be another practical issue shared in both urban and transportation planning. However, evidence-based guidance on the issue provided from the actual verification on whether or to what extent the proposed alternatives may have an effect seems to be absent. Therefore, with an emphasis on pedestrian safety, this study focused on the “median strip” alternative as a first example and, through a VR simulation experiment aimed at empirically examining its suggested role on enhancing street crossing safety and further exploring its possible influence on pedestrians’ trust toward autonomous driving. With 99 participants, perceived safety (individual assessments of safety), performance-based safety (crossing success/abandonment and collision occurrence), and trust were either questioned or recorded for nine scenarios with varying crossing conditions. A combination of multilevel models and cross-tabulation results indicate that medians seem especially significant in ensuring the performance-based safety results of pedestrians even when AVs are driving at high speeds or with smaller gaps, thus suggesting it a win–win option for both. Insights and implications on the role and management of medians in future streets are further provided. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; Future streets; Pedestrian safety; Street design; Urban and transportation planning; Virtual reality","Accidents, Traffic; Autonomous Vehicles; Humans; Pedestrians; Safety; Virtual Reality; Walking; Pedestrian safety; Regression analysis; Urban transportation; Virtual reality; Autonomous Vehicles; Future street; On-street parking; Performance based; Street crossing; Street design; Traffic lanes; Transportation planning; Urban and transportation planning; Vehicle design; autonomous vehicle; human; pedestrian; prevention and control; safety; traffic accident; virtual reality; walking; Autonomous vehicles","","","","","Chung-Ang University, CAU; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST, (2021R1C1C1013336)","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2021R1C1C1013336).

This systematic review therefore aimed to synthesize existing evidence regarding the efficacy of VR-based exercise on physical fitness in people with ID. Eligible articles were searched through six major electronic databases from inception until August 15, 2022. Returned studies were screened through predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data from the included studies were then extracted and synthesized. A total of 13 randomized controlled trials were included and 12 of them were found to have good research quality. Different physical fitness outcomes were evaluated: (1) muscular fitness (d = 0.05-2.12; proportion of effect = 5/6), (2) cardiorespiratory fitness (d = 0.12-0.67; proportion of effect = 5/5), (3) flexibility (d = 0.81; proportion of effect = 1/2), (4) body composition (d = 0.10; proportion of effect = 2/3), (5) balance (d = 0.23-1.65; proportion of effect = 6/7), (6) coordination (d = 0.19-0.48; proportion of effect = 2/3), (7) speed and agility (d = 0.13-0.46; proportion of effect = 4/4), and (8) overall motor proficiency (d = 0.02-1.08; proportion of effect = 1/3). While there was some preliminary evidence showing that VR-based exercise could improve muscular fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, balance, and speed and agility in individuals with ID, other outcomes showed less conclusive or limited positive evidence. Overall, additional studies are needed to understand the benefits of VR-based exercise on physical fitness in people with ID. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.","Intellectual disability; Physical fitness; Research synthesis; Virtual reality","Exercise; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Physical Fitness; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Virtual Reality; exercise; fitness; human; intellectual impairment; randomized controlled trial (topic); virtual reality","","","","","South China Normal University, SCNU, (22TKKA03); National Social Science Fund of China, NSSFC, (20BTY027, 22BTY062)","X.L. is partially supported by the Golden Seed Fund in South China Normal University (22TKKA03).

Boxing as a form of exercise has been shown to have mental health benefits in adults. Methods: This study investigated the impact of boxing exercise with a virtual reality (VR) game vs. with a guided video on anxiety, stress, and executive function in adolescents. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts: Oculus Rift BOXVR game (n = 14), boxing with a guided workout video (n = 14), or a non-intervention control (n = 14). The BOXVR and guided video groups participated in 10-minute exercise sessions, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. Results: The groups were comparable at baseline on all outcomes. Only BOXVR participants exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in stress and significant improvements on the Trail Making Test (TMT) B at weekly checkpoints and follow up. All cohorts showed improvements in executive function on the TMT A. At the end of the study, the BOXVR group reported significantly lower stress levels than the guided video group, and significantly better TMT A & B scores than the control group. Only the control group showed a significant reduction in anxiety but the groups were not significantly different in anxiety at the end of the study. The BOXVR group reported significantly greater enjoyment after each exercise session than the guided video group. Conclusion:BOXVR was shown to be effective in reducing adolescent stress and improving executive function over a three-week period. While larger studies with real-life functional outcomes are necessary, boxing with an immersive VR game represents a potential non-pharmaceutical mode to reduce stress in adolescents that is easy to implement in school settings.","Boxing; Executive function; High school; Stress; Virtual reality","Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Boxing; Cognition; Humans; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Social Media; adolescent; adult; anxiety; boxing; cognition; controlled study; human; pilot study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; social media; therapy","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","21617856","","","36745402","English","Games Health J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160457079"

One potential target for VR use is childhood behavior problems, which are often associated with social-cognitive deficits that can be difficult to measure or modify. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 36 boys between the ages of 8-13 to assess the usability of a VR device and its feasibility as a psychiatric tool for youth. Each participant experienced three virtual school cafeteria scenes that varied in antisocial content and the intentions of a virtual counterpart (VC) (control, ambiguous, or hostile). Following each scene, participants completed questions about ease and comfort in using the headset as well as an assessment of hostile attribution bias (HAB). HAB is the tendency to attribute hostile motivations to others' behaviors, which contributes to antisocial thoughts and behaviors. Following this VR use, participants completed a standard text assessment of HAB. Results: In general, participants reported the VR headset to be enjoyable and easy to use, and scenes worked as intended, with VCs in the hostile scene rated the meanest. In addition, boys with more conduct problems reported that virtual characters were meaner to them, despite no difference in text vignette measures of HAB. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the further development of VR programs to assess and treat childhood behavior problems.

Because of this, it is now possible to gain a better understanding of cognitive demands when working in operational environments, where individuals are often required to multitask. Multitasking often results in performance decrements, where adding more tasks can cause a decrease in performance in each of the individual tasks. However, little research investigated multitasking performance in simulated environments. In the current study we examined how multitasking affects performance in simulated environments. Forty-eight participants performed a dual visual search and word memory task where participants were navigated through a simulated environment while being presented with words. Performance was then compared to single-task performance (visual search and word memory alone). Results showed that participants experienced significant dual-task interference when comparing the dual-tasks to the single-tasks and subjective measures confirmed these findings. These results could provide useful insight for the design of technology in operational environments, but also serve as an evaluation of MRT in simulated environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-tasking; Verbal recall; Vigilance; Virtual reality; Visual search","Humans; Task Performance and Analysis; Virtual reality; Dual-tasks; Multi tasking; Operational environments; Performance; Real-world; Simulated environment; Verbal recall; Vigilance; Visual search; Visual word; adult; alertness; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; simulation; task performance; virtual reality; word memory test; word recognition; task performance; Multitasking","","","","","","","Abdi H., Williams L.J., Valentin D., Multiple factor analysis: principal component analysis for multitable and multiblock data sets: multiple factor analysis, Wiley Interdiscip.

However, the literature does not clearly define the concept of peer collaborative clinical decision-making (PCCDM). This hybrid concept analysis explored and established the definition of PCCDM among nursing students in simulation. METHOD: A total of 19 articles were reviewed, and 11 dyads of nursing students were interviewed after participating in virtual reality simulation for their perspectives on PCCDM. RESULTS: Five major themes were identified: group (1) communication; (2) awareness; (3) regulation; (4) reasoning; and (5) emotion. The conceptual definition of PCCDM is a dynamic, nonhierarchical, and group-level process of cognitive and socioemotional interactions among peers about a clinical situation that involves group communication, awareness, and regulation of reasoning and emotion within the collaborative space. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides a conceptual definition of PCCDM in nursing simulation as well as a pathway for developing a theoretical framework and instrument.

These adult students possess significant expertise in other areas and may benefit substantially in deliberate practice to acquire skills competency using immersive virtual reality (IVR) for clinical procedures before they practise in actual clinical settings. Objectives: This study aims to (1) examine the impact of IVR clinical procedures on mid-career switch students in knowledge, game perception and user reaction; (2) to explore the mid-career switch students' perceptions and experiences in using the IVR clinical procedures. Design: A mixed methods feasibility study was used. Setting and participants: This study was conducted at a university in Singapore with 34 first-year mid-career switch students. Methods: This study is a single-group pre-test and post-test experimental study on learning clinical procedures using IVR in the home setting. The study took place from September to November 2021. Focus group discussions were conducted and analysed verbatim using thematic analysis. Results: The students demonstrated significant improvement of knowledge for subcutaneous insulin, but overall, the increase in combined scores for both intravenous therapy and subcutaneous insulin were not statistically significant. Three overarching themes included: 1) Learning and practice, 2) Challenges and barriers, and 3) Personal attributes. Most of the participants found the experiences to be engaging, relevant, and satisfying. Some reported experiencing giddiness, headache, and lack of familiarity with technologies. Conclusions: IVR simulation can potentially be used as a supplementary learning tool to improve knowledge of clinical procedures in mid-career switch students. © 2023","Adult students; Clinical skills; Deliberate practice; Experiences; Home-based learning; Immersive virtual reality; Mid-career; Nursing students","Adult; Clinical Competence; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Humans; Insulins; Learning; Students, Nursing; Virtual Reality; insulin derivative; adult; clinical competence; human; learning; nursing education; nursing student; virtual reality","","Insulins, ","","","Ministry of Education Tertiary Education Research Fund 2020, (MOE2020-TRF-053); National University of Singapore, NUS, (2021-305)","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Ministry of Education Tertiary Education Research Fund 2020 ( MOE2020-TRF-053 ).; Funding text 2: The team wishes to thank the participants for contributing their time and for providing valuable data and insights to the study.

There are currently no VR applications that have been designed to assess or treat cognitive-communication disorders (CCDs) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, this study aimed to explore the views of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) who work with people who have a TBI to generate ideas and considerations for using VR in rehabilitation for CCDs. VR researchers were included to provide expert advice about VR technology. Method: A total of 14 SLPs and three VR specialists participated in an online interview or focus group. Semistructured discussions explored participants’ perspectives related to potential ideas for VR use and any perceived barriers and facilitators to VR implementation for managing CCDs following TBI. Data were video-and audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Results: Three main themes were generated from thematic analysis: VR is a tool that could enhance clinical practice, the need to consider and navigate potential red flags, and solutions to pave the way forward. Suggestions to overcome perceived barriers to VR use were also provided. Discussion: Participants expressed interest in using VR for rehabilitation of CCDs following TBI. However, potential barriers and risks to use should be considered prior to implementation. The findings offer guidance to support future research and development of VR in this field.

A total of 318 articles related to VC were identified on theguardian.com Web site and analyzed by text mining methodology. A thematic, content analysis using the Leximancer program was performed to explore VC as a concept, and its related concepts and concept associations. For the purposes of ""deep-dive insights,""further content and sentiment analyses were performed with MonkeyLearn and valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning. This triangulation in methodology enabled a comprehensive unstructured qualitative data analysis. The study identified key themes that characterize and define VC. It uncovered that, although there is predominantly positive sentiment toward VC reported in The Guardian online articles, negative sentiment also exists, presenting challenges for the industry to maneuver. The findings reveal that in the context of VC, a virtual experience is also a social experience in a virtual space, which is becoming and evolving. There are certain industries and sectors that are embracing VC, such as marketing, advertising and public relations, software development/IT, art/design, and entertainment, as well as science/technology. Some sectors and industries are experiencing challenges, such as security/law enforcement and medical, and hence display negative sentiment toward VC. Overall, this study presents a working definition of VC, a synopsis of the state of VC, and highlights areas for potential research to further our understanding of this phenomenon. It contributes to an improved understanding of VC for the industry and academia, and provides impetus for future studies focused on the emergent VC-relevant conceptual relationships.

One of the newly developed techniques is to use virtual reality (VR) games to increase motivation and adherence during exercise sessions for this population. However, this area is still poorly investigated. This review aims to evaluate, summarize, and review published literature regarding the effects of VR exercise on cardiopulmonary function and the use of VR games as a tool for airway clearance technique in CF population. A systematic search was conducted using PEDro, MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and relevant associated keywords. Seventy-three citations were identified from the search, of which 10 were included in this review. Overall, the use of VR was found to have positive effects on cardiac function and improved adherence and motivation during the exercise sessions in people with CF. Incorporating VR into exercise and airway clearance interventions may be beneficial for people with CF. However, further studies with larger sample size and wider range of disease severity are required to be conducted in future.

This was a cross-sectional observational study, and 20 adults, 20 nonfaller older adults, and 20 faller older adults were assessed. The primary outcome was feasibility assessed with safety and satisfaction measures. Safety outcomes were associated with adverse events occurred during the experience with the immersive virtual reality system (IVRS), assessed through the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and by registering the falls, pain, or any discomfort reported by the participants. Satisfaction was assessed with a structured questionnaire, answered after 10 minutes of experiencing the IVRS. The dates were assessed with one-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test and Bonferroni post hoc test. The results showed that the IVRS was safe and the participants related good satisfaction with the system. Most of participants related no symptoms (93.6 percent) or light cybersickness symptoms (6.0 percent). There were no occurrences of falls or pain associated with the IVRS. The IVRS was feasible for adults and nonfaller and faller older adults.

Methods: The application of the system was conducted among undergraduate nursing students. In 2020, we cooperated with companies and jointly developed a virtual reality (VR) simulation of rehabilitation nursing for patients with cervical spondylosis (CS) and applied it to undergraduate nursing students. Results:The cumulative online training time of 79 students was (30.52±16.28) minutes/person and the average number of learning times was (3.12±1.78) times/person. Overall, 97.5% of the students rated the system as excellent. Conclusions: In thi s paper, we introduce the design, system construction, teaching design, and preliminary application effects of the system. In addition, we discuss the advantages, characteristics, limitations and countermeasures of the system, to provide reference for the construction of VR simulation experimental teaching courses for undergraduate nursing students under the background of new medical science.","","Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Humans; Rehabilitation Nursing; Spondylosis; Students, Nursing; Virtual Reality; human; nursing education; nursing student; rehabilitation nursing; spondylosis; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","19457359","","","37226353","English","Am J Health Behav","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160181903"

Design, Setting, and Participants: Published surveys on virtual interviewing were reviewed and modified to design two surveys, for interns and for faculty who interviewed. Interns and faculty members from the Departments of Surgery and Medicine at one institution who participated in the 2020-2021 virtual interview process completed the surveys four to six months after the start of the academic year. Following survey completion, surgical interns from the same application cycle participated in one in-person focus group nine months after the start of the academic year to clarify points raised in the surveys. Results: Forty-six interns and faculty members responded to the survey (subgroup response rates ranging from 13-30%) and ten interns participated in the focus group (participation rate 100%). Most faculty and intern participants found that expectations formed during virtual interviews were accurate. However, our respondents noted limitations to virtual interviews that reduced their usefulness, including challenges with unnatural social interactions, understanding city fit, and getting a sense of resident and program culture. Participants provided possible solutions to address these challenges. Conclusions: Overall, this mixed-methods study at a single institution found that perceptions from virtual interviews were generally accurate but with some limitations.

In particular, VR allows an interaction in the virtual world. The aim of this study was to evaluate the students’ attitude toward a mobile VR application for teaching tooth morphologies. Methods: Eighty-two first year dental students were enrolled. After using the VR learning environment with mobile VR glasses at home for 1 week, the students were asked to fill in a questionnaire with 21 questions regarding intuitive handling, and supplemental learning information in comparison to the use of conventional textbooks. Nine questions provided predefined answer options, another nine had the form of a visual analog scale (VAS, range 0%-highly negative to 100%-highly positive), and three allowed free text answers. The data were checked for normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and was analyzed descriptively. Results: Forty-four percent of the students rated their perception of understanding of dental morphologies much better with VR than with conventional learning. The potential of the VR learning environment for further dental topics was assessed with a median VAS score of 75.8%. Its intuitive handling was evaluated with a median VAS score of 67.1%. The haptic, visual, and auditory supplemental learning information was consistently rated positively with VAS scores of 73.9%, 80.0%, and 71.6%, respectively. Overall, a majority of the students (85.5%) recommended the VR learning environment for dental morphology. Conclusions: The VR dental learning environment allows dental students an additional learning opportunity of dental morphologies, recommended by more than 85% of students. © 2022 The Authors.

Background: The accurate world-referenced description of relative locations of surface objects, when viewed from an oblique slant angle (aircraft, observation post) is hindered by (1) the compression of the visual scene, amplified at a lower slang angle, (2) the need for mental rotation, when viewed from a non-northerly orientation. Approach: Participants viewed a virtual reality (VR)-simulated four-object scene from either of two slant angles, at each of four compass orientations, either unaided, or aided by an AR head-mounted display (AR-HMD), depicting the scene from a top-down (avoiding compression) and north-up (avoiding mental rotation) perspective. They described the geographical layout of four objects within the display. Results: Compared with the control condition, that condition supported by the north-up SA display shortened the description time, particularly on non-northerly orientations (9 s, 30% benefit), and improved the accuracy of description, particularly for the more compressed scene (lower slant angle), as fit by a simple computational model. Conclusion: The SA display provides large, significant benefits to this critical phase of ground-air communications in managing an attack—as predicted by the task analysis of the JTAC. Application: Results impact the design of the AR-HMD to support combat ground-air communications and illustrate the magnitude by which basic cognitive principles “scale up” to realistically simulated real-world tasks such as search and rescue. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","augmented reality; head-mounted display; mental rotation; situation awareness; spatial judgments","Augmented Reality; Awareness; Humans; Smart Glasses; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; Helmet mounted displays; Job analysis; Virtual reality; Condition; Ground based; Ground-air communication; Head-mounted-displays; Joint terminal attack controllers; Mental rotation; Situation awareness; Spatial judgments; Spatial relations; Spatial transformation; augmented reality; awareness; human; virtual reality; Augmented reality","","","","","Albert Armonda; FAR-UI, (N00014-19-C-2026); VRR; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N171-091); Colorado State University, CSU","This experiment was supported by a subcontract to Colorado State University from Virtual Reality Rehabilitation, which obtained support from this research from the Office of Naval Research on topic N171-091 “Synthetic Vision System for Ground Forces via Fused Augmented Realities (FAR-UI),” SV4GF contract # N00014-19-C-2026.

Thirty professional car drivers drove a fixed-base driving simulator in real and simulated worlds under No Time Pressure (NTP) and Time Pressure (TP) driving conditions. Drivers rated their perceptions based on real-world driving and simulator driving experiences after each driving session with respect to three factors: simulator sickness, mental workload, and sense of presence. The structural equation model results revealed that drivers experienced high mental workload due to TP driving conditions (factor loading = 0.90) and repeated exposure to simulated world (factor loading = 0.20) which induced simulator sickness (factor loading = 0.41) and resulted in low sense of presence (factor loading = −0.18). Thus, it can be concluded that lack of experience with virtual reality induced high simulator sickness, increased mental workload, and low sense of presence. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Driving simulator; mental workload; sense of presence; simulator sickness; time pressure","Automobile Driving; Computer Simulation; Humans; Workload; car driving; computer simulation; human; workload","","","","","Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, IIITD; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, IIT","This research was financially supported by the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay.

Virtual reality (VR) could be a promising tool for delivering SCT. Presently, it is unknown how improvements in emotion recognition develop during (VR-)SCT, which factors impact improvement, and how improvements in VR relate to improvement outside VR. Data were extracted from task logs from a pilot study and randomized controlled trials on VR-SCT (n = 55). Using mixed-effects generalized linear models, we examined the: (a) effect of treatment session (1-5) on VR accuracy and VR response time for correct answers; (b) main effects and moderation of participant and treatment characteristics on VR accuracy; and (c) the association between baseline performance on the Ekman 60 Faces task and accuracy in VR, and the interaction of Ekman 60 Faces change scores (i.e., post-treatment - baseline) with treatment session. Accounting for the task difficulty level and the type of presented emotion, participants became more accurate at the VR task (b = 0.20, p < 0.001) and faster (b = -0.10, p < 0.001) at providing correct answers as treatment sessions progressed. Overall emotion recognition accuracy in VR decreased with age (b = -0.34, p = 0.009); however, no significant interactions between any of the moderator variables and treatment session were found. An association between baseline Ekman 60 Faces and VR accuracy was found (b = 0.04, p = 0.006), but no significant interaction between difference scores and treatment session. Emotion recognition accuracy improved during VR-SCT, but improvements in VR may not generalize to non-VR tasks and daily life.  © 2023 Saskia A. Nijman et al.

The Rural Road Map for Action (RRM) was developed in February 2017 and provides a guiding framework for a coordinated, pan-Canadian approach to physician rural work force planning and improved access to rural health care. METHODS: The Rural Road Map Implementation Committee (RRMIC) was formed in February 2018 to support the implementation of the RRM. The RRMIC was co-sponsored by the College of Family Physicians of Canada and the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada and had a broad membership that deliberately crossed sectors supporting the RRM's social accountability vision. RESULTS: In April 2021, the \""Rural Road Map: Report Card on Access to HealthCare in Rural Canada\"" was discussed at a Society of Rural Physicians of Canada national forum. Next steps included: focusing on equitable access to rural health care service delivery; enhancing rural physician resource planning including national medical licensure and the adoption of more effective strategies for rural physician recruitment and retention; improving access to rural specialty care; supporting the work of the National Consortium on Indigenous Medical Education; and developing metrics as useful tools to facilitate change in rural health care, social accountability in medical education and provisions for supporting the delivery of virtual health care. DISCUSSION: Collaborative partnerships and commitments from all key stakeholders will be critical to addressing national and regional health work force needs. No one sector alone can fix the inequitable health care realities of people living in rural communities in Canada.","","Canada; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Physicians, Family; Population Groups; Rural Health; Rural Health Services; Rural Population; Canada; general practitioner; health care delivery; human; population group; rural health; rural health care; rural population","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","14456354","","","36802686","English","Rural Remote Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148400778"

However, the role played by complex emotions elicited by virtual nature, such as awe, needs to be fully elucidated. Awe is an emotion stemming from vast stimuli, including nature, and virtual reality (VR) emerged as an effective medium to elicit it. One hundred nineteen participants were exposed to either one of four VR environments: (a) an awe-inspiring virtual nature, (b) a non-natural awe-inspiring virtual scenario, (c) a non-awe-inspiring virtual nature, (d) a non-natural non-awe-inspiring scenario. Pro-environmental attitudes, intentions, discrete emotions, and affect were measured and compared across the different conditions. Two ad hoc tasks were developed to measure two pro-environmental behaviors after each VR exposure. Participants were invited to sign a real petition against plastic production, consumption, and in favor of plastic recycling (a personally engaging behavior), and to take flyers to spread the word on the petition to friends and acquaintances (a socially engaging behavior). Awe-inspiring virtual nature resulted in a significantly increased number of flyers taken by participants (vs. control). Disposition toward the protection of the environment, positive emotional affect, and condition significantly correlated with the number of flyers taken. These results indicated that awe-inspiring virtual nature can influence socially engaging pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors but not personally engaging ones.  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","awe; emotions; pro-environmental behaviors; sustainability; virtual reality","Emotions; Friends; Humans; Virtual Reality; adult; article; emotion; female; friend; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; pro-environmental behavior; recycling; virtual reality","","","","","Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester, FSE; Fondazione Cariplo","The work has been funded by Fondazione Cariplo, grant: “Promoting Education of Scientific and Technological Societal Issues Through Sublime (PROMETHEUS)” No.: 2019-3536, and by the grant PON R&I 2014-2020 (FSE REACT-EU).

In the search to identify those factors, the research objective was to test whether three-dimensional perception affects presence in virtual environments. A controlled within-group experiment utilizing perception and presence questionnaires was conducted, followed by data analysis, to test the hypothesized unidirectional association between three-dimensional perception and presence in two different virtual environments (non-immersive and immersive). Results indicate no association in either of the systems studied, contrary to the assumption of many scholars in the field but in line with recent studies on the topic. Consequently, VR applications in architectural design may not necessarily need to incorporate advanced stereoscopic visualization techniques to deliver highly immersive experiences, which may be achieved by addressing factors other than depth realism. As findings suggest that the levels of presence experienced by users are not subject to the display mode of a 3D model (whether immersive or non-immersive display), it may still be possible for professionals involved in the review of 3D models (e.g., designers, contractors, clients) to experience high levels of presence through non-stereoscopic VR systems provided that other presence-promoting factors are included. © 2022 The Authors","Design technology; Human factors; Presence; Three-dimensional perception; Virtual environments; Virtual reality","Humans; Perception; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; 3D modeling; Stereo image processing; Three dimensional displays; Virtual reality; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Built environment; Critical steps; Design technologies; Immersive; Presence; Research objectives; Stereoscopic visualization; Three-dimensional perception; adult; aged; architecture; Article; clinical article; data analysis; design; education; female; human; information processing; male; perception; questionnaire; three dimensional computer aided design; virtual reality; visual-spatial ability test; work environment; computer interface; perception; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development; Georgia Institute of Technology, GIT; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work was supported by the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) .

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, computer-based community health nursing virtual reality simulation among postlicensure nursing students. Method: This mixed methods study consisted of 67 postlicensure community health nursing students who completed a pretest, computer-based virtual reality simulation, and a posttest and evaluation. Results: The majority of participant scores increased from pretest to posttest, and most participants agreed that the computer-based virtual reality simulation was effective; new knowledge and skills learned, the material that was found to be most help-ful, and benefits to nursing practice were identified. Conclusion: This community health nursing comput-er-based virtual reality simulation was effective at in-creasing participants’ knowledge and confidence with learning. © 2023, Slack Incorporated.

In this study, we investigated and compared the effects of AR-, VR- and video-based training on short- and long-term objective performance measures and subjective evaluations in a manual assembly task. Our results showed that there was no difference between AR-, VR- and video-based training concerning the objective performance measures task completion time and error count. However, in the subjective evaluations VR-based training showed a significantly higher perceived task load and a lower usability rating than the AR- and video-based training regimes. An exploratory analysis additionally revealed partially better results for AR than for VR after adjusting the data for the age of the participants. Future research should further investigate the advantage of AR- and video-based methods over VR when the age and technology experience of participants are taken into account. © 2023 The Authors","Augmented reality; Training and long-term retention; Virtual reality","Humans; Technology; Virtual Reality; E-learning; Virtual reality; Assembly tasks; Error counts; Exploratory analysis; Long-term retention; Manual assembly; Objective performance measures; Subjective evaluations; Task completion time; Training and long-term retention; Workers'; adult; article; augmented reality; exploratory research; female; human; human experiment; male; usability; videorecording; virtual reality; technology; Augmented reality","","","","","HSD Hochschule Döpfer in Cologne; HEAD-Genuit-Stiftung","Prof. Dr. Sabine J.

In today's work environments, giving presentations and performing in front of others are often essential and expected. Therefore, public speaking anxiety can have a serious impact on an individual's job performance, career choice, and prospects. Contemporary consumer virtual reality hardware has made it possible to practice public speaking anywhere in a safe and private virtual reality environment (VRE). As VREs offer the means to practice real-life scenarios, they also make it possible to go beyond what is ""real""; to replace simulations with more dynamic and innovative training environments. Furthermore, with occupational life undergoing a significant shift toward technology-mediated working conditions, innovative tools and methods could also be used during virtually implemented real-time social interactions. This research aimed to study the ways in which an illusion of height, that is, perceived tallness versus perceived shortness, without any visible virtual body or representation, influences state speech anxiety and emotional responses of participants during simulation of a stressful speech task. The experiment followed a strictly controlled between-subject procedure, and both self-reported and psychophysiological data were collected. Results indicate that participants perceiving the illusion of tallness felt less anxious and had lower self-reported arousal compared with participants with the illusion of shortness. This implies that even simple, visual, first-person perspective manipulation of the VRE could help individuals to reduce their stress responses during a task-oriented situation.  © 2023 Anna-Leena Macey et al.

GazeBaseVR comprises 5,020 binocular recordings from a diverse population of 407 college-aged participants. Participants were recorded up to six times each over a 26-month period, each time performing a series of five different ET tasks: (1) a vergence task, (2) a horizontal smooth pursuit task, (3) a video-viewing task, (4) a self-paced reading task, and (5) a random oblique saccade task. Many of these participants have also been recorded for two previously published datasets with different ET devices, and 11 participants were recorded before and after COVID-19 infection and recovery. GazeBaseVR is suitable for a wide range of research on ET data in VR devices, especially eye movement biometrics due to its large population and longitudinal nature. In addition to ET data, additional participant details are provided to enable further research on topics such as fairness. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Eye Movements; Eye-Tracking Technology; Humans; Saccades; Virtual Reality; Young Adult; eye movement; human; saccadic eye movement; virtual reality; young adult","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1714623, DGE-1144466, DGE-1840989)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-1840989 and DGE-1144466.

Evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, are providing synergistic opportunities to create new and exciting educational platforms. The evolution of these platforms will likely play a significant role in dental education. This is especially true in the wake of calamities like the COVID-19 pandemic during which educational activities had to be shutdown or moved online. This experience demonstrated that it is prudent to develop curricula that are both agile and efficient via creating hybrid courses that provide effective learning experiences regardless of the mode of delivery. Although there is growing interest in incorporating technology into dental education, there are few examples of how to actually manage the implementation of technology into the curriculum. In this paper, we provide a road map for incorporating technology into the dental curriculum to create agility and discuss challenges and possible solutions. © 2022 American Dental Education Association.","computer-assisted instruction; curriculum innovation; dental education; institutional/organizational development; patient simulation","Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Curriculum; Education, Dental; Humans; Pandemics; Technology; artificial intelligence; curriculum; dental education; epidemiology; human; pandemic; technology","","","","","","","Escobar-Castillejos D., Noguez J., Neri L., Magana A., Benes B., A review of simulators with haptic devices for medical training, J Med Syst, 40, 4, (2016); Buck G.H., Development of simulators in medical education, Gesnerus, 48, 1, pp. 7-28, (1991); Ayoub A., Pulijala Y., The application of virtual realityand augmented reality in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, BMC Oral Health, 19, 1, pp. 1-8, (2019); Nassar H.M., Tekian A., Computer simulation and virtual reality in undergraduate operative and restorative dental education: a critical review, J Dent Educ, 84, 7, pp. 812-829, (2020); Buchanan J.A., Use of simulation technology in dental education, J Dent Educ, 65, 11, pp. 1225-1231, (2001); San Diego J.P., Newton T., Quinn B.F.A., Cox M.J., Woolford M.J., Levels of agreement between student and staff assessments of clinical skills in performing cavity preparation in artificial teeth, Eur J Dent Educ, 18, 1, pp. 58-64, (2014); Shan T., Tay F.R., Gu L., Application of artificial intelligence in dentistry, J Dent Res, 100, 3, pp. 232-244, (2021); Hayes K.A., Lehmann C.U., The interactive patient: a multimedia interactive educational tool on the World Wide Web, MD Comput, 13, 4, pp. 330-334, (1996); Shahrbanian S., Ma X., Aghaei N., Korner-Bitensky N., Moshiri K., Simmonds M.J., Use of virtual reality (immersive vs. non immersive) for pain management in children and adults: a systematic review of evidence from randomized controlled trials, Eur J Exp Biol, 2, 5, pp. 1408-1422, (2012); Moro C., Stromberga Z., Raikos A., Stirling A., The effectiveness of virtual and augmented reality in health sciences and medical anatomy, Anat Sci Educ, 10, 6, pp. 549-559, (2017); Radianti J., Majchrzak T.A., Fromm J., Wohlgenannt I., Asystematic review of immersive virtual reality applications for highereducation: Design elements, lessons learned, and research agenda, Comput Educ, 147, (2020); Albuha Al-Mussawi R.M., Farid F., Computer-based technologies in dentistry: types and applications, J Dent (Tehran), 13, 3, pp. 215-222, (2016); Tse B., Harwin W., Barrow A., Quinn B., Cox M., Design and development of a haptic dental training system-hapTEL, International Conference on Human Haptic Sensing and Touch Enabled Computer Applications, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp. 101-108, (2010); Joda T., Gallucci G.O., Wismeijer D., Zitzmann N.U., Augmentedand virtual reality in dental medicine: A systematic review, Comput Biol Med, 108, pp. 93-100, (2019); Khandelwal K., Upadhyay A.K., Virtual reality interventionsin developing and managing human resources, Hum Resour Dev Int, 24, 2, pp. 219-233, (2021); Huang T.-K., Yang C.-H., Hsieh Y.-H., Wang J.-C., Hung C.-C., Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applied in dentistry, Kaohsiung J Med Sci, 34, pp. 243-248, (2018); Suner A., Yilmaz Y., Piskin B., Mobile learning in dentistry: usage habits, attitudes and perceptions of undergraduate students, PeerJ, 7, (2019); Towers A., Field J., Stokes C., Maddock S., Martin N., A scoping review of the use and application of virtual reality in pre-clinical dental education, Br Dent J, 226, 5, pp. 358-366, (2019); Joda T., Gallucci G.O., Wismeijer D., Zitzmann N.U., Augmented and virtual reality in dental medicine: a systematic review, Comput Biol Med, 108, pp. 93-100, (2019); Bolman L.G., Deal T.E., Reframing Organizations: Artistry, Choice and Leadership, (2013); Quinn B., Field J., Gorter R., Et al., COVID-19: the immediate response of European academic dental institutions and future implications for dental education, Eur J Dent Educ, 24, 4, pp. 811-814, (2020); Cox M.J., Quinn B.F., Learning leaders: teaching and learning frameworks in flux impacted by the global pandemic, Can J Learn Technol, 47, 4, pp. 1-20, (2021); Bolman L.G., Gallos J.V., Reframing Academic Leadership, pp. 116-117, (2011); Kouzes J.M., Posner B.Z., The Leadership Challenge, pp. 120-121, (2017); Bolman L.G., Gallos J.V., Reframing Academic Leadership, pp. 104-105, (2011); Bolman L.G., Deal T.E., Reframing Organizations: Artistry, Choice, and Leadership, (2008); Bolman L.G., Gallos J.V., Reframing Academic Leadership, pp. 65-67, (2011); Bolman L.G., Gallos J.V., Reframing Academic Leadership, pp. 117-126, (2011)","A.

However, no consensus has been reached on the effects of iVR on pain, psychological distress, and functional disability. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of iVR on pain, psychological distress, and functional disability in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders compared with no rehabilitation and conventional rehabilitation. Methods: Five electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science) were searched from January 2016 to December 2021. All randomized controlled trials using iVR for treating pain, psychological distress, and functional disability in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders were included. A subgroup analysis was conducted to compare the effects of nonimmersive and immersive types of iVR on the outcomes of interest. Results: Our study provides good quality evidence that iVR reduced overall pain by 9.28 points as compared with no rehabilitation and by 8.09 points as compared with conventional rehabilitation. In the subgroup analysis, nonimmersive iVR showed a reduction in psychological distress (standardized mean differences = -0.35) as compared with no rehabilitation. However, no statistically significant difference in the outcomes existed between nonimmersive and immersive iVR. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in the outcomes of functional disability. Conclusions: iVR is recommended for reducing pain intensity more than no rehabilitation or conventional rehabilitation. Meanwhile, nonimmersive iVR has been proposed for psychological distress improvement, with effects similar to those of conventional rehabilitation. However, iVR may not be an effective intervention in the case of functional disability.

There is, however, a lack of measurement tools to evaluate assistive systems considering these principles. Consequently, this study developed a measurement tool for the quantitative evaluation of the fulfilment of each principle for assistive systems. A systematic literature review was performed to identify dimensions belonging to the principles, identify how previous research evaluated these dimensions, and develop a measurement tool for assistive systems. Findings show that scales commonly used for evaluating assistive systems disregard several aspects highlighted as relevant by research, implying the need for considering the DIN 92419 principles. Based on established scales and theoretical findings, a questionnaire, and a checklist for evaluating assistive systems were developed. The work provides a grounding for measuring relevant aspects of assistive systems. Further development is needed to substantiate the reliability and validity of the proposed questionnaire scales and items. Practitioner Summary: Responding to the gap of a holistic measurement tool to evaluate assistive systems, a systematic literature review was performed considering the DIN 92419 principles. This resulted in a comprehensive summary of relevant aspects of assistive systems that were made numerically measurable, which proposes better criteria to assess assistive systems.

Based on a survey of current Zepeto users (N = 200), a popular metaverse application that enables people to create avatars and socialize while exploring the virtual spaces, we investigated (a) the key motives of Zepeto use, (b) how Big Five personality traits predict specific motives of Zepeto use, and (c) how specific motives of Zepeto use are associated with users' psychological well-being. Overall, users were largely driven by the desire to explore the virtual world and enjoy unique experiences, but such a tendency was stronger among those higher on openness and agreeableness. Extroverts were more likely to use Zepeto for functional purposes, while those higher on neuroticism turned to Zepeto to escape from reality. As for psychological consequences, while those using Zepeto for functional and escaping purposes reported higher levels of loneliness, those who used Zepeto for social and experiential goals were less lonely. The experiential and escape motives predicted perceived social support in the opposite directions. Moreover, by comparing Zepeto users' responses with those of non-users (N = 200), we found that (a) non-users overestimated users' motives of Zepeto use, especially social and escape motives, (b) Zepeto users were higher on extraversion and openness than non-users, and (c) users reported higher levels of loneliness than non-users with no significant difference in perceived social support. Implications of the findings and future directions are discussed.  © Eun-Ju Lee et al., 2023; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Big Five personality traits; loneliness; metaverse; social support; uses and gratifications; Zepeto","Humans; Motivation; Neuroticism; Personality; Psychological Well-Being; Social Behavior; human; motivation; neurosis; personality; psychological well-being; social behavior","","","","","Korean Sociological Association; Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2021S1A3A2A02090597)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2021S1A3A2A02090597) and the Korean Sociological Association.","Chen BX., What's All the Hype about the Metaverse?, (2022); Alvim L., How the Metaverse Could Impact the World and the Future of Technology, (2022); Byun H., Naver's Metaverse Platform Zepeto Hits 300m Users, (2022); Mental Health and COVID-19: Early Evidence of the Pandemic's Impact; Katz E, Blumler JG, Gurevitch M., Uses and gratifications research, Public Opin Q, 37, 4, pp. 509-523, (1973); Hassouneh D, Brengman M., A motivation-based typology of social virtual world users, Comput Hum Behav, 33, pp. 330-338, (2014); Zhou Z, Jin X-L, Vogel D, Et al., Individual Motivations for Using Social Virtual Worlds: An Exploratory Investigation in Second Life, Proceedings of the 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1-10, (2010); Zhou Z, Jin X-L, Vogel DR, Et al., Individual motivations and demographic differences in social virtual world uses an exploratory investigation in second life, Int J Inf Manag, 31, 3, pp. 261-271, (2011); DeVito MA, Birnholtz J, Hancock JT, Et al., How People Form Folk Theories of Social Media Feeds and What It Means for How We Study Self-Presentation, Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 111, pp. 1-12, (2018); Maruping LM, Agarwal R., Managing team interpersonal processes through technology: A task-technology fit perspective, J Appl Psychol, 89, pp. 975-990, (2004); Huang C., Social network site use and Big Five personality traits: A meta-analysis, Comput Hum Behav, 97, pp. 280-290, (2019); Liu D, Campbell WK., The Big Five personality traits, Big Two metatraits and social media: A meta-analysis, J Res Personal, 70, pp. 229-240, (2017); Seidman G., Self-presentation and belonging on Facebook: How personality influences social media use and motivations, Personal Individ Differ, 54, 3, pp. 402-407, (2013); de Hesselle LC, Rozgonjuk D, Sindermann C, Et al., The associations between Big Five personality traits, gaming motives, and self-reported time spent gaming, Personal Individ Differ, 171, (2021); COVID-19 and Well-Being: Life in the Pandemic, (2021); Keeter S., Many Americans Continue to Experience Mental Health Difficulties as Pandemic Enters Second Year, (2021); 2021 COVID-19 National Mental Health Survey Quarterly Results Announced, (2021); Killgore WDS, Cloonan SA, Taylor EC, Et al., Loneliness: A signature mental health concern in the era of COVID-19, Psychiatry Res, 290, (2020); Valkenburg PM., Social media use and well-being: What we know and what we need to know, Curr Opin Psychol, 45, (2022); Hancock J, Liu SX, Luo M, Et al., Psychological well-being and social media use: A meta-analysis of associations between social media use and depression, anxiety, loneliness, eudaimonic, hedonic and social well-being, SSRN, (2022); Gilchrist K., Virtual Reality Investments Are a Long-Term Play for Businesses Targeting Gen Z, Says South Korea's Zepeto, (2021); Sohn J., SoftBank Bets on Asian Metaverse Platform Selling Digital Gucci, (2021); Kline RB., Principles and Practice of Structural Equation Modeling, (2015); Henseler J, Ringle CM, Sarstedt M., A new criterion for assessing discriminant validity in variance-based structural equation modeling, J Acad Mark Sci, 43, pp. 115-135, (2015); Gosling SD, Rentfrow PJ, Swann WB., A very brief measure of the Big-Five personality domains, J Res Personal, 37, 6, pp. 504-528, (2003); Wongpakaran N, Wongpakaran T, Pinyopornpanish M, Et al., Development and validation of a 6-item Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (RULS-6) using Rasch analysis, Br J Health Psychol, 25, 2, pp. 233-256, (2020); Zimet GD, Dahlem NW, Zimet SG, Et al., The multidimensional scale of perceived social support, J Pers Assess, 52, 1, pp. 30-41, (1988); Allen MS, Iliescu D, Greiff S., Single item measures in psychological science: A call to action, Eur J Psychol Assess, 38, pp. 1-5, (2022)","E.-J.

Background: VIMS is a common side-effect when watching dynamic visual content from various sources, such as virtual reality, movie theaters, or smartphones. A reliable questionnaire predicting individual susceptibility to VIMS is currently missing. The aim was to fill this gap by introducing the Visually Induced Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (VIMSSQ). Methods: A survey and an experimental study were conducted. Survey: The VIMSSQ investigated the frequency of nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and eyestrain when using different visual devices. Data were collected from a survey of 322 participants for the VIMSSQ and other related phenomena such as migraine. Experimental study: 23 participants were exposed to a VIMS-inducing visual stimulus. Participants filled out the VIMSSQ together with other questionnaires and rated their level of VIMS using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). Results: Survey: The most prominent symptom when using visual devices was eyestrain, and females reported more VIMS than males. A one-factor solution with good scale reliability was found for the VIMSSQ. Experimental study: Regression analyses suggested that the VIMSSQ can be useful in predicting VIMS (R2 =.34) as measured by the SSQ, particularly when combined with questions pertaining to the tendency to avoid visual displays and experience syncope (R2 =.59). Conclusion: We generated normative data for the VIMSSQ and demonstrated its validity. Application: The VIMSSQ can become a valuable tool to estimate one’s susceptibility to VIMS based on self-reports. © Copyright 2021, The Author(s).","cybersickness; migraine; sex; simulator sickness; virtual reality","Asthenopia; Female; Humans; Male; Motion Sickness; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality; Diseases; Regression analysis; Virtual reality; Cybersickness; Induced motions; Migraine; Motion sickness; Sex; Side effect; Simulator sickness; Smart phones; Visual content; Visual devices; asthenopia; female; human; male; motion sickness; questionnaire; reproducibility; virtual reality; Surveys","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2017-04387)","BK is supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council (NSERC) of Canada RGPIN-2017-04387.

Patients with axSpA suffer from neck pain and stiffness and have severe and permanent restrictions in movement. Patients are advised to carry out prescribed exercises to maintain mobility, but most do not comply with this advice due to the unnatural nature of head and neck stretching exercises. Clinicians currently only test cervical rotation of patients with axSpA a few times per year. Pain and stiffness can fluctuate between appointments, and there is a need to accurately measure the patient's spinal mobility at home. METHODS: Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have been proven to be accurate and reliable when measuring neck movement. We are using VR to aid relaxation and promote mindfulness, whilst moving the participant's head to visual and auditory cues to enable completion of exercises. In this ongoing study, we are testing whether a smartphone-enabled VR system could be feasible for the measurement of cervical movement at home. RESULTS: The ongoing research will have a positive impact on the lives of patients suffering from axSpA. Regular measurement and assessment of spinal mobility at home will be beneficial to patients and clinicians for objective mobility measurement. DISCUSSION: Implementing VR as both a distractive and rehabilitation encouragement technique could improve patient engagement whilst simultaneously collecting granular mobility data. Additionally, implementing VR rehabilitation using smartphone technology will offer an inexpensive method of exercise and effective rehabilitation.","","Axial Spondyloarthritis; Exercise; Humans; Medicine; Pain; Virtual Reality; exercise; human; medicine; pain; spondylarthritis; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","14456354","","","36802673","English","Rural Remote Health","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148394579"

Materials and Methods: The demographic data of the patients were recorded. A total of 73 patients were divided into two groups (35 in experimental group and 38 in control group). All patients were evaluated with pain (visual analog scale [VAS]), functionality (Lysholm functional knee score [LFKS], 6 minutes walking test [6MWT]), disability (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC]), and balance (Berg Balance Scale [BBS]) before treatment, after treatment (3th weeks), and 4 weeks after treatment (7th weeks). In the experimental group, plus the conservative treatment, a total of 15 sessions of a disease-specific gamification through VR glasses were applied. Results: VAS and WOMAC scores of the experimental group were lower at the 3th and 7th weeks than those of the control group (P = 0.005, P = 0.000), (P = 0.000). LFKS of the experimental group was higher at the 3th and 7th weeks than that of the control group (P = 0.005, P = 0.013). No difference was found between the groups in terms of 6MWTs (P > 0.05). BBS score of the experimental group was higher in the 7th week than that of the control group (P = 0.021). Conclusion: In knee OA, the disease-specific gamification through VR glasses added to the conservative treatment has a positive effect on pain, functionality, and balance. Side effects such as mild nausea, headache that did not last long, require additional treatment. In light of this, disease-specific gamification through VR glasses is effective and safe in knee OA, more studies that reveal the long-Term effect on structural healing must be planned. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.","Knee osteoarthritis;

However, its scalability is constrained by unequal medical-nursing cohort size, rendering a great challenge for all nursing students to form an interprofessional team with medical students. With the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), an AI medical team player can be integrated into virtual reality simulations for more nursing students to engage in interprofessional team training. Objectives: To describe the development of a novel AI-enabled virtual reality simulation (AI-enabled VRS) and to evaluate nursing students' competencies and experiences in communicating with an AI medical doctor. Methods: A mixed-methods design using a one-group pretest-posttest design and focus group discussions were employed in the evaluation phase. Nursing students from a university were recruited to undertake the 2-hour AI-enabled VRS. Pre-test and post-tests were administered to evaluate the participants' communication knowledge and self-efficacy. Survey questionnaires were administered to examine their experiences with the virtual reality environment and the AI doctor. Five focus group discussions were conducted to gain deeper insight into their learning experiences. Results: The participants demonstrated significant improvements in communication knowledge and interprofessional communication self-efficacy after the learning. They reported positively on the acceptability, feasibility and usability of the AI-enabled VRS. The subscale of “human-like” feature of the AI medical doctor was rated the lowest. Three themes surrounding participants' experiences of the virtual learning emerged: “relate to the real world”, “artificial intelligence versus human intelligence” and “complement with face-to-face learning”. Conclusions: This study demonstrates initial evidence on the potential of AI-enabled VRS in fostering nursing students' learning on interprofessional communication skills. The findings have also provided insights on how to improve the AI-enabled VRS, in particular, the expressiveness of the AI pedagogical agent and facilitating more dialogue trainings with learner-agent conversations. © 2023","Artificial intelligence; Interprofessional education; Nurse-physician communication; Serious game; Simulation; Team training; Virtual reality","Artificial Intelligence; Communication; Computer Simulation; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Simulation Training; Students, Nursing; Virtual Reality; adult; article; artificial intelligence; case report; clinical article; conversation; doctor nurse relation; feasibility study; female; human; human experiment; interpersonal communication; interprofessional education; learning; male; nursing student; physician; pretest posttest design; questionnaire; self concept; simulation; skill; usability; virtual reality; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; interpersonal communication; nursing student; public relations; simulation training","","","","","Tertiary Education Research Fund; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (MOE 2020-TRF-042)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the National University of Singapore Information Technology for supporting the implementation of the AI-enabled VRS.

The Mirrosistant is a device that helps dental students become proficient with use of indirect vision mirror operation. This study aimed to explore the role of the Mirrosistant on students’ performance with the virtual simulation dental training system. Materials and methods: A total of 72 dental students were equally assigned to the Control group and the Experimental group. Subsequently, Mirrosistant was used to conduct a series of mirror training exercises in the Experimental group. The training consisted of tracing the edge and filling in the blank of the prescribed shape, as well as preparing the specified figure on raw eggs using indirect vision via Mirrosistant. Next, both groups were examined using the SIMODONT system, a virtual reality dental trainer, for mirror operation. In addition, a five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess student feedback by using Mirrosistant. Results: The mirror operation examination conducted by the SIMODONT system revealed that mirror training using Mirrosistant had statistically improved students’ performances (score: 80.42 ± 6.43 vs. 69.89 ± 15.98, P = 0.0005) and shorten their performance time of mirror operation (time of seconds: 243.28 ± 132.83 vs. 328.53 ± 111.89, P = 0.0013). Furthermore, the questionnaire survey indicated that the participants had positive attitudes toward the mirror training using Mirrosistant.

In this research, we developed a novel eHMI concept that aimed to support pedestrians’ risk evaluation by displaying predicted real-time risk levels. In a virtual reality environment, we measured pedestrians’ road-crossing behavior when they encountered AVs with this eHMI and manual-driven vehicles (MVs) in the same lane. Results showed that pedestrians exhibited typical crossing behaviors based on gap size for both vehicle types. In segregated traffic conditions, compared to MVs, eHMI-equipped AVs made pedestrians more sensitive to the changes in gap size by rejecting more small gaps and accepting more large gaps. Pedestrians also walked faster and kept larger safety margins for smaller gaps. Similar results were observed for AVs in mixed traffic conditions. However, in mixed traffic conditions, pedestrians faced more challenges when interacting with MVs as they tended to accept smaller gaps, walk more slowly, and maintain smaller safety margins. These findings indicate that dynamic risk information could be conducive to pedestrians’ road-crossing behavior, but the use of eHMIs on AVs might disrupt pedestrians’ interactions with MVs in complex traffic conditions. This potential risk shift among vehicles also poses the question of whether AVs should use segregated lanes to reduce their indirect impacts on pedestrian-MV interactions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; External Human-Machine Interfaces; Mixed traffic condition; Road-crossing behavior; Virtual reality","Accidents, Traffic; Autonomous Vehicles; Humans; Pedestrians; Safety; Walking; Man machine systems; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Virtual reality; Autonomous Vehicles; External human-machine interface; Gap size; Human Machine Interface; Mixed traffic; Mixed traffic condition; Road crossing behavior; Safety margin; Small gaps; Traffic conditions; autonomous vehicle; human; pedestrian; prevention and control; safety; traffic accident; walking; Autonomous vehicles","","","","","Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities, (2020084); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31970998)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31970998 ) and the Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities ( 2020084 ).","Ackermann C., Beggiato M., Schubert S., Krems J.F., An experimental study to investigate design and assessment criteria: What is important for communication between pedestrians and automated vehicles?, Appl.

This pilot explored students’ understanding of individuals’ needs with dementia, as well as, the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as a curricular tool. Second-year medical students (n = 150) completed a pre-survey, Embodied Labs, Inc. Beatriz Lab VR module, and a post-survey. Most students knew someone with dementia (72%), were a family member of someone with dementia (52%) or had worked with a patient (61%) with dementia. Using paired survey questions, students reported significant increases in understanding how their lives would be affected by dementia (71% vs. 94%) and the needs of a person with dementia (64% vs. 95%) after VR. They reported increased understanding of being a caregiver of someone with dementia (24% vs. 81%) and the impact it can have on the entire family (64% vs. 97%). Overall students agreed this simulation made them think about their approach to clinical skills (94%) and should be utilized more in the curriculum (76%). This pilot study indicated that this VR experience can be used to advance understanding of a person’s experiences with dementia and that integrating VR into the medical curricula should be considered. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; embodiment; empathy; simulation; virtual reality","Alzheimer Disease; Geriatrics; Humans; Pilot Projects; Students, Medical; Virtual Reality; Alzheimer disease; education; geriatrics; human; medical student; pilot study; virtual reality","","","","","","","Adefila A., Graham S., Clouder L., Bluteau P., Ball S., myShoes–the future of experiential dementia training?, The Journal of Mental Health Training, Education and Practice, 11, 2, pp. 91-101, (2016); Igniting change: AGE-u-cate training institute, (2021); Ausburn L.J., Ausburn F.B., Desktop virtual reality: A powerful new technology for teaching and research in industrial teacher education, Journal of Industrial Teacher Education, 41, (2004); Baron-Cohen S., Wheelwright S., The empathy quotient: An investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 34, 2, pp. 163-175, (2004); Batson C.D., Empathy-induced altruism: Friend or foe of the common good?, Forsyth, D.R., Hoyt, C.L.

The primary goal of the research is to investigate how auditory sensations and visual stimuli influence people's behaviour in outdoor built environments. Our technique compares people's perception of the built environment in different conditions: the real world and a replicated virtual world. As a case study, a university campus was used, and four experimental conditions were designed. The study followed a between-subjects design, and the data collection included gaze data acquired from an eye-tracking device as well as self-reports. The study concludes that sound influences human behaviour in such settings. More specifically conclusions are that: i) human behaviour in virtual replications of the real space, including both visual and sound stimuli, is tendentially more similar to human behaviour in the real world than in simulations omitting sound; and ii) there is a difference in human behaviour when people explore the same virtually replicated outdoor space, by varying the presence of sound. This study is particularly useful for researchers working on the comparison between human behaviour in virtual and real environments, related to visual and sound stimuli. © 2022 The Authors","Gaze; Outdoor spaces; Sound","Acoustic Stimulation; Eye-Tracking Technology; Humans; Sound; Virtual Reality; Behavioral research; Data acquisition; Eye tracking; Built environment; Eye-tracking; Gaze; Human behaviors; Outdoor space; Outdoors settings; People behavior; Real-world; Space perception; Visual cues; adult; Article; auditory response; auditory stimulation; controlled study; correlation analysis; depth perception; exploratory behavior; eye tracking; female; frequency modulation; health impact assessment; human; male; perception; qualitative analysis; saccadic eye movement; social life; sound; task performance; validation process; virtual reality; visual feedback; visual stimulation; walking speed; sound; virtual reality; Virtual reality","","","","","AAL OLA, (AAL 2014–076); Marie Curie IRIS, (610986, FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IAPP); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/04466/2020, UIDP/04466/2020)","We thank all participants that took part in the experiments.

Design: We conducted a systematic review and meta-synthesis on the experiences among undergraduate nursing studies who received SBL. Data sources: We searched through six databases namely PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest, for qualitative studies published from January 2011 to January 2022. Review methods: A meta-synthesis was conducted according to the three-stage framework outlined by Thomas and Harden (2008). Critical appraisal was performed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. A standardised data extraction form was developed with reference from JBI Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument Data Extraction Tools for Qualitative Research (JBI-QARI) checklist for data extraction. Results: Fifteen studies were included, and four themes emerged from the synthesis: (1) acquiring knowledge and skills through SBL; (2) positive experiences of using high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and virtual reality simulation (VRS) methods; (3) challenges encountered while using SBL methods and (4) drawing parallels between simulation and real clinical settings. Conclusion: SBL allowed undergraduate nursing students to gain knowledge, acquire skills and have a positive SBL experiences. However, the provision of innovative strategies and resources for nursing students to overcome SBL-based challenges are still needed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Experiences; High fidelity simulation; Nursing education; Simulation-based learning; Undergraduate nursing students; Virtual reality simulation","Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Humans; Qualitative Research; Students, Nursing; checklist; Cinahl; data extraction; drawing; Embase; high-fidelity simulation; human; human experiment; Medline; nursing education; nursing student; qualitative research; review; Scopus; simulation; simulation training; skill; synthesis; systematic review; virtual reality; Web of Science; procedures","","","","","","","Adib-Hajbaghery M., Sharifi N., Effect of simulation training on the development of nurses and nursing students’ critical thinking: a systematic literature review, Nurse Educ.

This paper presents the results from a virtual reality simulation study that recorded pedestrians performing mid-block crossings on a straight segment of an urban street. The experiment was designed with eight scenarios with combinations of one or two lanes, two vehicle speeds, and constant or variable gaps between vehicles. The experiment was conducted with 48 subjects producing 538 crossing observations. The results show that subjects, on average, watched about 5 vehicle gaps in traffic before crossing the street and accepted a gap of 4.5 s between vehicles to cross. A regression model showed that the vehicle speed, the number of lanes, and subjects in the 66–85 years old group had a significant effect on the gap value accepted to cross. An interaction term based on gender and number of lanes also had a significant effect on the accepted gap. The study found average walking speeds between 4.1 and 4.8 ft/s (1.2–1.4 m/s) for different scenarios. A regression model revealed that the gender, the number of lanes, and the gap accepted to cross influenced the walking speed. Significant effects of interactions of the age with gender, number of lanes, and vehicle speed variables were also found that explain the differences in walking speed. The results for the success rate when crossing the street showed the overall worst performance in the scenario with traffic generated with a 25-mph (40 km/h) speed and a constant 3-s gap between vehicles. A Logit model showed that the probability of a pedestrian being hit by a vehicle increased with age, with traffic at the top vehicle speed, and with the constant 3-s vehicle gap. In contrast, the probability decreased with increases in the vehicle gap accepted to cross and the walking speed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Gap-acceptance; Mid-block crossing; Pedestrian behavior; Urban streets; Virtual reality simulation; Walking speed","Accidents, Traffic; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Pedestrians; Safety; Virtual Reality; Walking; Walking Speed; Pedestrian safety; Regression analysis; Virtual reality; Gap-acceptance; High frequency HF; Mid-block crossing; Number of lanes; Pedestrian behavior; Regression modelling; Urban streets; Vehicle speed; Virtual reality simulations; Walking speed; aged; human; pedestrian; prevention and control; safety; traffic accident; very elderly; virtual reality; walking; walking speed; Vehicles","","","","","Puerto Rico Transportation Technology Transfer Center; U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, OST-R, (69A3551747131)","This material is based upon work supported by the Safety Research Using Simulation (SAFER-SIM) University Transportation Center and funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology under Grant No.69A3551747131.

Additionally, the mediating role of presence (social and spatial presence) was considered. Results indicated that the news article presented through an immersive VR mode directly led to greater levels of presence and cognitive empathy but not affective empathy and fear. The effects on social presence further resulted in greater cognitive and affective empathy, not fear. Meanwhile, spatial presence enhanced by VR led to greater levels of emotions (affective empathy and fear) but not cognitive empathy. These findings suggest the dynamic mechanisms of how an immersive VR modality can function as a complementary tool for traditional news to improve audience engagement, which centers on emotion-related outcomes in tandem with cognitive responses.  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","disaster news; empathy; fear; immersive media; presence","Disasters; Emotions; Empathy; Humans; Virtual Reality; adult; article; disaster; emotion; empathy; fear; human; human experiment; major clinical study; videorecording; virtual reality; empathy","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2021S1A5C2A02088387)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2021S1A5C2A02088387).

However, the impact of long-term VR use on these symptoms has not been analyzed so far. In a preregistered study, we conducted an online survey among a bigger sample of VR users (N = 754) to investigate the relationship between time of use during the past 6 months and the presence of DPDR symptoms. The results support the absence of a linear association between time of VR use and the presence of symptoms, when controlling for other factors. DPDR symptoms are more frequent among younger female users and in those who experience higher levels of embodiment during use. Secondary analyses show that symptoms are more common among newer users and among those who engage in longer sessions. These findings suggest that current common VR experiences are not a cause of long-term DPDR symptoms for the majority of users, yet also encourage further research about specific cases where VR use might trigger DPDR experiences in the long term.  © Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023.","depersonalization; derealization; embodiment; spatial presence; virtual reality; well-being","Cross-Sectional Studies; Depersonalization; Female; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality; cross-sectional study; depersonalization; female; human; questionnaire; virtual reality","","","","","","","VR Usage & Consumer Attitudes, Wave VI, (2022); Allen C., It’s time to prepare yourself for ‘‘VR panic.’’ Wired, (2017); Madary M, Metzinger TK., Real virtuality: A code of ethical conduct.

Our main objective was to assess pre-post changes in the emotional health and quality of life of older adults with AD after participating in a 5-week nature-based VR program. Methods: Using in-depth interviews with VR participants and facility staff, we explored the health outcomes of participants as well as challenges to their participation. We recruited 11 participants. Results: We found an increase in participants' mean scores for pleasure and alertness and a decrease in mean scores for anxiety, sadness, and anger. In addition, we found that the quality-of-life mean scores significantly increased after program participation. In qualitative findings, we identified 3 main themes as possible mental health outcomes of the nature-based VR program: (1) enjoyment, (2) novel experience, and (3) reminiscence. On the other hand, participants experienced some challenges related to the VR gear and manipulating the VR controllers and goggles while engaged in the program. Conclusion: The nature-based VR program was instrumental in promoting emotional health and quality of life among older adults with AD. © 2023 PNG Publications.

Data were collected from forty-eight adults across varied office task scenarios (i.e., sending an email, setting up a timer/reminder, and searching for a phone number/address) and noise types (i.e., silence, non-verbal noise, and verbal noise). The baseline for this study is measured without the use of an IVA. Significant differences in performance and workload were found on both objective and subjective measures. In particular, verbal noise emerged as the primary factor affecting performance using an IVA. Task performance was dependent on the task scenario and noise type. Subjective ratings found that participants preferred to use IVA for less complex tasks. Future work can focus more on the effects of tasks, demographics, and learning curves. Furthermore, this work can help guide IVA system designers by highlighting factors affecting performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Background noise; Conversational agents; Digital personal assistants; Human-computer interaction; Intelligent virtual assistant; Office work","Adult; Humans; Noise; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface; Workload; Human computer interaction; Office buildings; Virtual reality; Background noise; Conversational agents; Intelligent virtual assistant; Noise types; Noisy environment; Office works; Performance; Task performance; Task workloads; Virtual assistants; adult; Article; cognitive load; demographics; e-mail; female; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; information processing; learning curve; male; noise; office worker; social media; task performance; workload; workplace; computer interface; noise; Personal digital assistants","","","","","Office Ergonomics Research Committee","This research was supported by a research grant from the Office Ergonomics Research Committee (OERC) .","Ammari T., Kaye J., Tsai J.Y., Bentley F., Music, search, and IoT, ACM Trans.

This article systematically reviews and appraises the quality of the literature on the use of VR-HMDs in medical education. A search in the databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO was carried out. Studies were screened according to predefined exclusion criteria, and quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. In total, 41 articles were included and thematically divided into 5 groups: anatomy, procedural skills, surgical procedures, communication skills, and clinical decision making. Participants highly appreciated using VR-HMD and rated it better than most other training methods. Virtual reality head-mounted display outperformed traditional methods of learning surgical procedures. Although VR-HMD showed promising results when learning anatomy, it was not considered better than other available study materials. No conclusive findings could be synthesized regarding the remaining 3 groups.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Anatomy learning; clinical decision making; communication skills; head-mounted display;

The COVID-19 pandemic forced disruptive innovation meaning a number of valuation studies conducted interviews via videoconference. These studies found online interviews feasible and acceptable; however, studies were not constructed to test the impact of online versus face-to-face interviews. This study builds on its sister study from the UK and aims to assess the acceptability and equivalence of in person face-to-face interviews with online interviews on cTTO valuation outcomes and on data quality. Methods: Participants were recruited into a randomised equivalence study via an external research company. Consenting participants were randomly allocated to complete a cTTO interview face-to-face or online, using the same 10 EQ-5D-5L health states. Mean and distribution of the cTTO values, participant understanding, data quality, demographic characteristics, participant preference, participant engagement and participant feedback were all compared across interview mode. Statistical equivalence for cTTO values for each state was tested using two one-sided t-tests by mode. Finally, regression analysis was completed to assess the impacts of interview mode on cTTO value while controlling for demographic characteristics of the participants. Results: Mean cTTO values were shown to be equivalent for mild health states and showed no significant difference for serious health states. The proportion of individuals who expressed an interest in the study but declined to arrange an interview after finding out their randomisation was significantly higher for the face-to-face (21.6%) than the online group (1.8%). No significant difference was found between groups for participant engagement, understanding or feedback nor for any indicators of data quality. Conclusion: Administrating interviews face to face or online did not appear to have a statistically significant impact on mean cTTO values. Offering both online and face-to-face interviews routinely allows all participants to select the most convenient option. © 2023 The Authors","Composite time trade off (TTO); EQ-5D-5L; EuroQol valuation protocol (EQ-VT); Videoconference","COVID-19; Health Status; Humans; Pandemics; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; comparative study; data quality; demography; health status; innovation; Internet; trade-off; valuation; virtual reality; adult; article; controlled study; data quality; demographics; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; female; health status; human; human experiment; interview; outcome assessment; randomization; randomized controlled trial; time trade-off method; videoconferencing; pandemic; quality of life; questionnaire","","","","","EuroQol Research Foundation","This project received funding from the EuroQol Research Foundation .

This view provides an important correction on embodied accounts of language that reduce language to action, perception, emotion and mental simulation. The presence of a language system has, however, also important consequences for perception, action, emotion, and memory. Language stamps signals from perception, action, and emotional systems with rich cognitive markers that transform the role of these signals in the overall cognitive architecture of the human mind. This view does not deny that language is implemented by means of universal principles of neural organization. However, language creates the possibility to generate rich internal models of the world that are shaped and made accessible by the characteristics of a language system. This makes us less dependent on direct action-perception couplings and might even sometimes go at the expense of the veridicality of perception. In cognitive (neuro)science the pendulum has swung from language as the key to understand the organization of the human mind to the perspective that it is a byproduct of perception and action. It is time that it partly swings back again. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Brain; Language; Mental models; Mind; Placebo; Predictive processing","Computer Simulation; Emotions; Humans; Language; placebo; action observation network; association; brain damage; cognition; cognitive model; emotion; executive function; facial expression; human; hypothesis; language; language development; memory; mental health; motor control; Note; perception; placebo effect; sense organ; striate cortex; virtual reality; computer simulation; emotion","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (024.001.006)","I am grateful to Roshan Cools, Willem Levelt, Floris de Lange, Ashley Lewis, Antje Meyer, Guillermo Montero-Melis, Esther Steenbeek-Plantenga for their comments on earlier versions of this essay.

To supplement the lack of exposure, the Surgical Exploration and Discovery (SEAD) program was transitioned to an entirely virtual format. This study aims to describe the virtual SEAD program and evaluate its effectiveness as a career decision-making (CDM) intervention. DESIGN: The week-long program was delivered on Microsoft Teams, featured 11 surgical specialties, and comprised four activities: live demonstrations, virtual operating room observerships, career talks, and technical skills workshops. The program was evaluated using the four levels of the Kirkpatrick model: (1) reactions, (2) knowledge, (3) CDM behaviors – assessed using the Career Decision-making Difficulties Questionnaire (CDDQ) – and (4) results. The latter was indirectly assessed using CDDQ scores from an in-person SEAD program, where lower CDDQ scores indicate less difficulty with CDM. SETTING: Faculty of Medicine at the University of Ottawa in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Forty pre-clerkship students (27 first and 13 second year students) at the University of Ottawa RESULTS: Level 1: 97.5% of participants rated the program as good or very good. Live demonstration and technical skills workshops were the highest rated activities. Level 2: participants’ scores on knowledge-based questions about a surgical career significantly increased following the program (pre: 9/25 vs post: 15/25, p = 0.008). Level 3: overall mean CDDQ scores (±SD) decreased difficulties with significantly following the program (pre: 45.6 ± 10.5 vs post: 38.8 ± 10.9, p < 0.001), which indicates decreased CDM difficulties. Level 4: Except for one sub-category, the difference in mean CDDQ scores between the virtual and in-person programs were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: The program received the positive reactions and significantly increased participants’ knowledge.

Most high-fidelity visual displays include an expensive system of high-definition projectors and wraparound screens. To reduce the overall cost of a driving simulator while preserving the generalizability of results to naturalistic driving, head mounted displays (HMD) are being considered as a substitute visual cueing system. Recent innovations to virtual reality technologies are encouraging, however, differences between HMDs and more traditional visual displays have not been explored for all types of driving measures. In particular, while existing literature provides insight into the validity of HMDs as a substitute for higher fidelity visual displays in tests of driver behaviour and performance, there is a gap in the literature regarding differences in physiological responses. In the current study, upper body muscle activation and joint angle ranges were compared between an Oculus™ Rift Development Kit 2 HMD and a system of wrap around screens. Twenty-one participants each completed two simulated drives, one per display, in a counterbalanced order. During the simulation, drivers encountered unanticipated pedestrian crossings during which peak surface electromyography, root-mean-square of the surface electromyography signal and joint angles were determined bilaterally on the upper limbs. No significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed between the Oculus™ Rift HMD and the wrap around screens for all dependent variables with the exception of left joint range of motion in female participants, suggesting that the HMD reduced field of view had a minimal effect on driver kinematics and no effect on muscle activation levels. Upper body bracing was observed during the hazard response time segments characterized by significantly increased muscle activity during hazard response time segments and minimal joint movement. Considering the lack of significant kinematic and muscle activation differences between the two visual inputs, HMD technology for hazard response may provide a suitable alternative to wrap around screens for studying kinematic responses during hazardous driving scenarios. © 2022","Driving simulation; Hazard reaction; Head mounted display; Kinematics; Surface electromyography; Wrap around screens","Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Muscles; Pedestrians; Reaction Time; Smart Glasses; Automobile drivers; Automobile simulators; Chemical activation; Helmet mounted displays; Human reaction time; Kinematics; Muscle; Physiological models; Street traffic control; Virtual reality; Driving simulation; Driving simulator; Hazard reaction; Hazard response; Head-mounted-displays; Kinematic response; Muscle activation; Surface electromyography; Visual display; Wrap-around screens; adult; Article; car driving; controlled study; driver; female; hazard; human; human experiment; joint function; kinematics; male; muscle function; pedestrian safety; range of motion; reaction time; simulation; surface electromyography; task performance; virtual reality; biomechanics; muscle; pedestrian; Hazards","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI","Funding for this study was provided by grants to the fifth author from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .","Agrawal R., Knodler M., Fisher D.L., Samuel S., Virtual reality headset training: can it Be used to improve young drivers' latent hazard anticipation and mitigation skills, Transport.

At present, the purpose of this study is to explore the long-term influence of VR simulator teaching on the practice performance of medical students. Method: This is a one-year long-term follow-up study of a randomized controlled study. A total of 117 participants who completed the initial study were invited to participate in the follow-up study. Participants in the VR group and the control group were required to complete a questionnaire developed by the authors and the teachers in the teaching and research department and to provide their surgical internship scores and Objective Structure Clinical Examination(OSCE) graduation scores. Results: Of the 117 invitees, 108 completed the follow-up. The answers to the questions about career choice and study habits were more positive in the VR group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The total score for clinical practice in the VR group was better than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the OSCE examination, the scores for physical examination, suturing and knotting and image reading were higher in the VR group than in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the one-year long-term follow-up indicated that compared with medical students experiencing the traditional teaching mode, those experiencing the VR teaching mode had more determined career pursuit and active willingness to learn, better evaluations from teachers in the process of surgical clinical practice, and better scores in physical examination, suturing and knotting and image reading in the OSCE examination. In the study of nonlinear dynamics to cultivate a good learning model for medical students, the VR teaching model is expected to become an effective and stable initial sensitive element.

The aims of this study were a) to assess differences in pedestrian skill between children with ADHD and typically-developing children and b) to examine relations between pedestrian skill and attention, inhibition, and executive function among children with ADHD as well as among typically-developing children. Methods: A sample of 50 children with mean age of 9 years participated, 56% of them diagnosed with ADHD. Children completed IVA + Plus, an auditory-visual test evaluating impulse response control and attention and then engaged in a Mobile Virtual Reality (MVR) pedestrian task to assess pedestrian skills. Parents completed the Barkley’s Deficits in Executive Functions Scale-Child & Adolescents (BDEFS-CA) to rate children’s executive function. Children with ADHD engaged in the experiment off any ADHD medications. Results: Independent samples t-tests indicated significant differences between the two groups in all IVA + Plus and BDEFS_CA scores, supporting the clinical diagnoses of ADHD and the distinction between the two groups. Independent samples t-tests also indicated differences in pedestrian behavior: Children in the ADHD group had significantly higher numbers of unsafe crossings in the MVR environment. Partial correlations within samples stratified by ADHD status indicated that for both groups of children, there were positive correlations between unsafe pedestrian crossings and executive dysfunction. There were no relations between IVA + Plus attentional measures and unsafe pedestrian crossings in either group. A linear regression model predicting unsafe crossings was significant, with children with ADHD more likely to cross in a risky manner after controlling for executive dysfunction and child age. Conclusions: ADHD children exhibited riskier street-crossing behavior in the MVR, confirming an increased risk of pedestrian injury among children with ADHD compared to typically-developing children. Risky crossing among the typically-developing children and ADHD was related to deficits in executive function. Implications are discussed in relation to parenting and professional practice. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","ADHD; child safety; Executive function; injury; mobile virtual reality; pedestrian safety","Accidents, Traffic; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Case-Control Studies; Child; Executive Function; Humans; Virtual Reality; adolescent; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; case control study; child; executive function; human; physiology; traffic accident; virtual reality","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01HD088415); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Dr. Schwebel’s work on this project was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01HD088415.

However, how immersion, Virtual Environment contents, and sense of presence (SoP) influence emotional responses remains to be clarified to efficiently foster positive emotions. Consequently, a total of 26 participants (16 women, 10 men, 22.73 ± 2.69 years old) were exposed to 360-degree videos of natural and social contents on both a highly immersive Head-Mounted Display and a low immersive computer screen. Subjective emotional responses and SoP were assessed after each video using self-reports, while a wearable wristband collected continuously electrodermal activity and heart rate to record physiological emotional responses. Findings supported the added value of immersion, as more positive emotions and greater subjective arousal were reported after viewing the videos in the highly immersive setting, regardless of the video contents. In addition to usually employed natural contents, the findings also provide initial evidence for the effectiveness of social contents in eliciting positive emotions. Finally, structural equation models shed light on the indirect effect of immersion, through spatial and spatial SoP on subjective arousal. Overall, these are encouraging results about the effectiveness of VR for fostering positive emotions. Future studies should further investigate the influence of user characteristics on VR experiences to foster efficiently positive emotions among a broad range of potential users.  © 2023 Katarina Pavic et al.

Materials and Methods: The results were analyzed retrospectively. Seventy-eight patients with brain injury, undergoing rehabilitation treatment for motor impairment, were recruited. Among them, 51 were available for postintervention survey. The immersive type of VR training was programmed to facilitate use of the paralyzed upper extremity through a fishing simulation game. The Oculus Rift was used as head-mounted display device. Patients were observed for any AEs as defined in the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs during and after each VR training session. A postintervention telephone survey was done to investigate adherence-related factors and safety. Results: The results were analyzed after dividing the patients into nonadherence (patients participated <3 times) and high-adherence (≥3 times) groups. No serious AEs were reported during and after the VR training, and several patients reported other AEs, predominantly dizziness, with one case requiring cessation of VR training. Overall, the satisfaction rate was 54%. Compared with the nonadherence group, the high-adherence group expressed higher satisfaction with VR training, regarded it as effective for recovery from upper limb paralysis, accepted VR as comprehensible, and considered the level of difficulty to be appropriate (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Immersive VR training appeared to be safe for patients with brain injury.

Participants demonstrated changes in shoulder flexion angle and muscle activation under different virtual scenarios. Background: Conventional VRE studies often compared the outcomes between an experimental group that underwent exercise in VR and a real-world exercise control group, whereas comparisons between VRE programs are lacking. Besides, the attributes of VREs received little attention. Method: Thirteen able-bodied participants performed upper extremity exercise movements in immersive VR using a head-mounted display. Participants performed task-oriented and imitation-oriented movements with different game features. Shoulder muscle activity (the deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus) and shoulder motion were collected. Results: Practice type (task-oriented, imitation-oriented) significantly influenced the flexion angle of the shoulder complex (F(1,11) = 9.53, p =.01), and the muscle activity of the supraspinatus (F(1,9) = 12.61, p =.006) and the infraspinatus (F(1,9) = 12.71, p =.006). Game features did not have a statistically significant effect on shoulder flexion angle or shoulder muscles’ activations. Conclusions: Compared to imitation-oriented practice, task-oriented practice elicited more intensive shoulder movements and muscular efforts but also induced greater movement variations. Substantial differences across game features levels should be further investigated to have significant effects. Applications: This research may help guide the design of future VREs. For strength training or rehabilitation where intensive practice is required, task-oriented practice should be considered; for movement learning where movement consistency is required, imitation oriented practice should be adopted. © Copyright 2021, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","electromyography (EMG); motion tracking; practice and motivation; virtual environment","Electromyography; Exergaming; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Movement; Shoulder; Upper Extremity; Chemical activation; Helmet mounted displays; Motion analysis; Muscle; Electromyography; Experimental groups; Human kinematics; Motion tracking; Muscle activation; Muscle activities; Performance; Practice and motivation; Task-oriented; Virtual scenario; electromyography; human; imitation; movement (physiology); physiology; shoulder; upper limb; Virtual reality","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS-1822477)","This research was partially supported by National Science Foundation (IIS-1822477).

Often multitasking comes with performance costs, where the addition of more tasks impairs the performance of the tasks. The current study explored the extent to which multitasking interference can be characterised in simulated environments, as opposed to risky and harsh environments in real operational contexts. Forty-eight participants completed several trials where they performed a visual search task while navigating a simulated environment. There were three conditions: a standalone memory task, a standalone search task, and both tasks simultaneously. Results revealed significant dual-task interference when comparing the dual-task to each of the single-tasks. Results were corroborated by subjective workload and stress metrics. The results could prove useful for designing systems for individuals who routinely multitask in operational environments. Specifically, by furthering the understanding of their performance capabilities and trade-offs due to multitasking. Practitioner summary: Due to the demands of multitasking in operational environments, quantifying the degree of information lost on each task individually will aid in the understanding of the deficits of multitasking performance. This study shows that deficits in multi-tasking (via a HUD) can be understood in simulated environments to a similar degree as real-world tasks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","augmented reality; Multitasking; verbal recall; virtual reality; visual search","Humans; Memory; Smart Glasses; Task Performance and Analysis; Workload; Economic and social effects; Multitasking; Virtual reality; Dual-task interference; Head-UpDisplay; Heads-up-display; Operational environments; Performance; Pressung; Search tasks; Simulated environment; Verbal recall; Visual search; adult; article; augmented reality; clinical article; female; human; human experiment; male; memory; physician; physiological stress; quantitative analysis; simulation; verbal memory; virtual reality; word recognition; workload; task performance; Augmented reality","","","","","","","Abdi H., Williams L.J., Valentin D., Multiple Factor Analysis: Principal Component Analysis for Multitable and Multiblock Data Sets: Multiple Factor Analysis, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics, 5, 2, pp. 149-179, (2013); Allmacher C., Dudczig M., Klimant P., Putz M., Virtual Prototyping Technologies Enabling Resource-Efficient and Human-Centered Product Development, Procedia Manufacturing, 21, pp. 749-756, (2018); Atkinson R.C., Holmgren J.E., Juola J.F., Processing Time as Influenced by the Number of Elements in a Visual Display, Perception & Psychophysics, 6, 6, pp. 321-326, (1969); Barsom E.Z., Graafland M., Schijven M.P., Systematic Review on the Effectiveness of Augmented Reality Applications in Medical Training, Surgical Endoscopy, 30, 10, pp. 4174-4183, (2016); Becue-Bertaut M., Pages J., Multiple Factor Analysis and Clustering of a Mixture of Quantitative, Categorical and Frequency Data, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 52, 6, pp. 3255-3268, (2008); Blakely M.J., Kemp S., Helton W.S., Volitional Running and Tone Counting: The Impact of Cognitive Load on Running over Natural Terrain, IIE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors, 4, 2-3, pp. 104-114, (2016); Brehm J.W., Self A., (1989); Bretschneider N., Brattke S., Rein K., 2006, pp. 1-15, (2006); Broeker L., Liepelt R., Poljac E., Kunzell S., Ewolds H., de Oliveira R.F., Raab M., Multitasking as a Choice: A Perspective, Psychological Research, 82, 1, pp. 12-23, (2018); Capa R.L., Audiffren M., Ragot S., The Effects of Achievement Motivation, Task Difficulty, and Goal Difficulty on Physiological, Behavioral, and Subjective Effort, Psychophysiology, 45, 5, pp. 859-868, (2008); Chun M.M., Jiang Y., Contextual Cueing: Implicit Learning and Memory of Visual Context Guides Spatial Attention, Cognitive Psychology, 36, 1, pp. 28-71, (1998); Cipresso P., Giglioli I.A.C., Raya M.A., Riva G., The past, Present, and Future of Virtual and Augmented Reality Research: A Network and Cluster Analysis of the Literature, Frontiers in Psychology, 9, (2018); Darling K.A., Helton W.S., Dual-Task Interference between Climbing and a Simulated Communication Task, Experimental Brain Research, 232, 4, pp. 1367-1377, (2014); de Fockert J.W., Bremner A.J., Release of Inattentional Blindness by High Working Memory Load: Elucidating the Relationship between Working Memory and Selective Attention, Cognition, 121, 3, pp. 400-408, (2011); Dollaghan C., Biber M., Campbell T., Constituent Syllable Effects in a Nonsense-Word Repetition Task, Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 36, 5, pp. 1051-1054, (1993); Dong S., Behzadan A.H., Chen F., Kamat V.R., Collaborative Visualization of Engineering Processes Using Tabletop Augmented Reality, Advances in Engineering Software, 55, pp. 45-55, (2013); Epling S.L., Blakely M.J., Russell P.N., Helton W.S., Free Recall and Outdoor Running: Cognitive and Physical Demand Interference, Experimental Brain Research, 234, 10, pp. 2979-2987, (2016); Epling S.L., Blakely M.J., Russell P.N., Helton W.S., Interference between a Fast-Paced Spatial Puzzle Task and Verbal Memory Demands, Experimental Brain Research, 235, 6, pp. 1899-1907, (2017); Epling S.L., Edgar G.K., Russell P.N., Helton W.S., How Does Physical Demand Affect Cognitive Performance?

We used a 2 eyewear app type (AR vs. non-AR) by 2 privacy priming (prime vs. no prime) between-subject experimental design, and 114 Korean adults participated in the experiment. Results showed that AR had a main effect on perceived ease of use but not on perceived usefulness. Instead, the effect of AR on perceived usefulness was moderated by privacy priming such that the positive effect of AR on perceived usefulness was weaker when privacy concern was salient. Moreover, the results provided support for a moderated mediation model in which the indirect effect of AR on intent to use the app via perceived usefulness was moderated by privacy priming.

We used CFD to simulate 36 exposure scenarios of an infected patient sneezing at different distances and different angles while facing either the front or the side of a healthcare worker with or without goggles. The results show that medical goggles indeed block most droplets from the outer surface, but many droplets still deposit on the bottom edge (especially at the nose), inside the air holes and on the side edge. However, the edges of medical goggles have fitment problems with people in different regions, and the air holes do not function as filters and cannot prevent fine droplets from entering the interior and contacting the eyes. Our research demonstrates the feasibility of studying the design of PPE for airtightness and protection by means of CFD. Practitioner summary: Computational fluid dynamics can quickly and efficiently reflect the airtightness design problems of PPE. A model was developed using CFD to examine the protective effect of medical goggles in preventing the airborne transmission of viruses. The model demonstrates the feasibility of using CFD to solve ergonomic problems.
